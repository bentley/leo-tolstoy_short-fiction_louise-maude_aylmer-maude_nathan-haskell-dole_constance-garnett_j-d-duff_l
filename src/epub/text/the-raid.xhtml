				<p>On the twelfth of July, Captain Hlopov entered the low door of my earth-hut. He was wearing epaulettes and carrying a sword, which I had never seen him do before since I had reached the Caucasus.</p>
				<p>‘I come straight from the colonel’s,’ he said in answer to my questioning look. ‘To-morrow our battalion is to march.’</p>
				<p>‘Where to?’ I asked.</p>
				<p>‘To N. N. The forces are to assemble there.’</p>
				<p>‘And from there, I suppose, they will go into action?’</p>
				<p>‘I expect so.’</p>
				<p>‘In what direction? What do you think?’</p>
				<p>‘What’s there to think about? I am telling you what I know! A Tartar galloped here last night and brought orders from the general for the battalion to march with two days’ rations of rusks. But where to? Why, and for how long? We do not ask, my friend; we are told to go⁠—and that’s enough!’</p>
				<p>‘But if you are to take only two days’ rations of rusks, it proves that the troops won’t be out longer than that.’</p>
				<p>‘It proves nothing at all!'</p>
				<p>'How’s that?' I asked with surprise.</p>
				<p>‘Because it is so. We went to Dargo, and took one week’s rations of rusks, but we stayed there nearly a month.’</p>
				<p>‘Can I go with you?' I asked after a pause.</p>
				<p>‘You could, no doubt. But my advice is, don’t. Why run risks?'</p>
				<p>‘Oh, but you must allow me not to take your advice. I have been here a whole month, solely on the chance of seeing an action, and you wish me to miss it!’</p>
				<p>'Well, if you like! But really you had better stay behind. You could wait for us here, and might go hunting,—and we would go our way and it would be splendid,’ he said with such conviction that for a moment it really seemed to me too that it would be be 'splendid'. However, I told him decidedly that nothing would induce me to stay behind.</p>
				<p>'And what is there for you to see?’ the captain went on, still trying to dissuade me. 'Do you want to know what battles are like? Read Mikhaylovsky Danilevsky’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Description of War</i>. It’s a fine book; it gives a detailed account of everything. It gives the position of every corps, and describes how battles are fought.’</p>
				<p>'All that does not interest me,’ I replied.</p>
				<p>'What is it then? Do you simply wish to see how people are killed?— In 1832 we had a fellow here, also a civilian, a Spaniard I think he was. He took part with us in two campaigns, wearing some kind of blue mantle. Well, they did for the fine fellow. You won’t astonish any one here, friend!’</p>
				<p>Humiliating though it was that the captain so misjudged my motives, I did not try to disabuse him.</p>
				<p>'Was he brave?’ I asked.</p>
				<p>'Heaven only knows: he always used to ride in front; and where there was firing, there he always was.’</p>
				<p>'Then he must have been brave,’ said I.</p>
				<p>'No. Pushing oneself in where you are not needed, does not prove you to be brave.’</p>
				<p>'Then what do you call brave?’</p>
				<p>'Brave?— Brave?—' repeated the captain, with the air of one to whom such a question presents itself for the first time. 'He who does what he ought to do is brave,’ he said, after thinking awhile.</p>
				<p>I remembered that Plato defines courage as 'The knowledge of what should and what should not be feared,’ and despite the looseness and vagueness of the captain’s definition, I thought that the fundamental ideas of the two were not so different as they might appear, and that the captain’s definition was even more correct than that of the Greek philosopher. For if the captain had been able to express himself like Plato, he would no doubt have said that, 'He is brave, who fears only what should be feared and not what should not be feared.’</p>
				<p>I wished to explain my idea to the captain.</p>
				<p>'Yes,’ said I, 'It seems to me that in every danger there is a choice; and a choice made under the influence of a sense of duty—is courage, but a choice made under the influence of a base motive—is cowardice. Therefore a man who risks his life from vanity, curiosity, or greed, cannot be called brave; while, on the other hand, one who avoids a danger from honest consideration for his family, or simply from conviction, cannot be called a coward.'</p>
				<p>The captain looked at me with a curious kind of expression while I was speaking.</p>
				<p>'Well, that I cannot prove to you,' he said, filling his pipe, 'but we have a cadet here who is fond of philosophizing. You should have a talk with him. He also writes verses.'</p>
				<p>I had known of the captain before I left Russia, but I had only made his acquaintance in the Caucasus. His mother, Mary Ivanovna Hlopova, a small and poor landowner, lives within two miles of my estate. Before I left for the Caucasus, I had called on her. The old lady was very glad to hear that I should see her ‘Pashenka', by which pet name she called the grey-haired elderly captain, and that I, ‘a living letter,' could tell him all about her, and take him a small parcel from her. Having treated me to excellent pie and smoked goose, Mary Ivanovna went into her bedroom and returned with a good-sized black amulet, to which was attached a black silk ribbon.</p>
				<p>'Here, this is the icon of our Mother Mediatress of the Burning Bush,' said she, crossing herself and kissing the icon of the Virgin and placing it in my hands. ‘Please let him have it. You see, when he went to the Caucasus I had a Mass said for him, and promised, if he remained alive and safe, to order this icon of the Mother of God for him. And now, for eighteen years, the Mediatress and the Holy Saints have had mercy on him: he has not been wounded once, and yet in what battles has he not taken part?— What Michael, who went with him, told me, was enough, believe me, to make one’s hair stand on end. You see, what I know about him is only from others. He, my pet, never writes me about his campaigns, for fear of frightening me.’</p>
				<p>(After I reached the Caucasus I learnt, and then not from the captain himself, that he had been severely wounded four times, and of course never wrote to his mother either about his wounds or his campaigns.)</p>
				<p>'So let him now wear this holy image,’ she continued, 'I give it him with my blessing. May the most Holy Mediatress guard him. Especially when going to battle let him wear it. Tell him so, dear friend; say "Your mother wishes it.”’</p>
				<p>I promised to carry out her instructions carefully.</p>
				<p>'I know you will grow fond of my Pashenka,' continued the old lady. 'He is such a splendid fellow! Will you believe it, he never lets a year pass without sending me some money, and he also helps my daughter, Annoushka, a good deal, and all out of his pay! I thank God for having given me such a child,’ she continued with tears in her eyes.</p>
				<p>'Does he often write to you?’ I asked.</p>
				<p>'Seldom, my dear: perhaps once a year. Only when he sends the money, not otherwise. He says, "If I don’t write to you, mother, that means I am alive and well. Should anything befall me, which God forbid, they’ll tell you without me.”'</p>
				<p>When I handed his mother’s present to the captain (it was in my own quarters) he asked for a bit of paper, carefully wrapped it up, and then put it away. I told him many things about his mother’s life. He remained silent, and when I had finished speaking he went to a corner of the room, and busied himself for what ‘seemed a long time, filling his pipe.</p>
				<p>‘Yes, she’s a splendid old woman!’ he said from there, in rather a muffled voice. 'Will God let me ever see her again?’ These simple words expressed much love and sadness.</p>
				<p>‘Why do you serve here?’ I asked.</p>
				<p>‘One has to serve,’ he answered with conviction. ‘And to get double pay, as we do here in the Caucasus, means a great deal to poor men like myself.’</p>
				<p>The captain lived economically, did not gamble, rarely went carousing, and smoked the cheapest tobacco (which, for some reason, he called home-grown tobacco). I had liked the captain before; and after this talk I felt a sincere regard for him. He had one of those simple, calm, Russian faces which are easy and pleasant to look straight in the eyes.</p>

			<p>Next morning, at four o’clock, the captain came for me. He wore an old threadbare coat without epaulettes, wide Caucasian trousers, a white sheepskin cap, the wool of which had grown yellow and limp, and had a shabby Asiatic sword strapped round his shoulders. The small white horse he rode ambled along with short strides, hanging its head down and swinging its thin tail. Although the worthy captain’s figure was not very martial, nor even good-looking, it expressed such equanimity towards everything around him, that it involuntarily inspired respect.</p>
			<p>I did not keep him waiting a single moment, but mounted my horse at once, and we rode together through the gates of the fortress. The battalion was some five hundred yards in front of us, and looked like a dense, oscillating, black mass. It was only possible to guess that it was an infantry battalion by the bayonets which looked like needles standing close together, and by the sounds of the soldiers’ songs which occasionally reached us, the beating of a drum, and the delightful voice of the fifth company’s second tenor, which had so often charmed me in the fortress. The road lay along the middle of a deep and broad ravine, by the side of a stream which had overflowed its banks. Flocks of wild pigeons whirled above it, now alighting on the rocky banks, now turning in the air in rapid circles and vanishing out of sight.</p>
			<p>The sun was not yet visible, but the crest of the right side of the ravine was just beginning to be lit up. The grey and whitish rock, the yellowish-green moss, the dew-covered bushes of Christ’s-Thorn, dogberry and dwarf elm, appeared extraordinarily distinct and salient in the golden morning light; but the other side and the valley, wrapt in thick mist which floated in uneven strata, were damp and gloomy, and presented an indefinite mingling of colours: pale purple, almost black, dark green and white. Right in front of us, strikingly distinct against the dark-blue horizon, rose the bright dead-white masses of the snowy mountains, with their shadows and outlines, fantastic and yet exquisite in every detail. Crickets, grasshoppers, and thousands of other insects, awoke in the tall grasses and filled the air with their clear and ceaseless sounds: it was as if innumerable tiny bells were ringing inside our very ears. The air was full of the scent of water, grass, and mist—the scent of a lovely early summer morning. The captain struck a light and lit his pipe, and the smell of his cheap tobacco and of the tinder seemed extraordinarily pleasant to me.</p>
			<p>To overtake the infantry more quickly we left the road. The captain appeared more thoughtful than usual, did not take his Daghestan pipe out of his mouth, and at every step touched with his heels his horse, which swaying from side to side left a scarcely perceptible green track on the tall wet grass. From under its very feet, with the cry and the whirr of wings which involuntarily sends a thrill through every sportsman, rose a pheasant, which flew slowly upwards. The captain did not take the least notice of it.</p>
			<p>We had nearly overtaken the battalion, when we heard the thud of a galloping horse behind us, and that same minute a good-looking youth, in an officer’s uniform and a white sheepskin cap, galloped past us. In passing he smiled, nodded to the captain, and flourished his whip. I had only time to notice that he sat his horse and held his reins with peculiar grace, that he had beautiful black eyes, a fine nose, and only the first signs of a moustache. What specially pleased me about him was that he could not repress a smile when he noticed that we admired him. This smile alone showed him to be very young.</p>
			<p>‘Where is he galloping to?’ muttered the captain, with a dissatisfied air, without taking the pipe out of his mouth.</p>
			<p>‘Who is he?’ I asked.</p>
			<p>'Ensign Alanin, a subaltern in my company—. He came from the Cadet Corps only a month ago.’</p>
			<p>‘I suppose he is going into action for the first time,’ I said.</p>
			<p>‘That’s why he is so delighted,’ answered the captain, thoughtfully shaking his head. ‘Youth.’</p>
			<p>‘But how could he help being pleased? I can fancy how interesting it must be for a young officer.’</p>
			<p>The captain remained silent for a minute or two.</p>
			<p>‘That is just why I say “Youth,”’ he added in a deep voice. 'What is there to be pleased at without ever having seen the thing? When one has seen it many times, one is not so pleased. There are now, let us say, twenty of us officers here: one or other is sure to be killed or wounded, that is quite certain; to-day it may be I, to-morrow, he; the next day a third. So what is there to be pleased about?’</p>

				<p>As soon as the bright sun appeared above the hill and lit up the valley along which we were marching, the wavy clouds of mist cleared away and it grew hot. The soldiers, with muskets and sacks on their shoulders, stepped slowly along the dusty road. Now and then Little-Russian words and laughter could be heard in their ranks. Several old soldiers in white blouses (most of them non-commissioned officers) walked together by the roadside smoking their pipes and conversing gravely. Three-horsed heavily-laden wagons moved steadily along, raising thick clouds of dust that hung motionless in the air. The officers rode on in front: some of them caracoled, <abbr>i.e.</abbr> they whipped their horse, made it take three or four leaps, and then, turning its head back, stopped abruptly. Others were occupied with the singers, who in spite of the heat and sultriness sang song after song. With the mounted Tartars, about two hundred yards ahead of the infantry, rode a tall handsome lieutenant in Asiatic costume, on a large white horse. He was known in the regiment as a desperate dare-devil who would spit the truth out at anybody. He wore a black tunic trimmed with gold braid, leggings to match, soft closely-fitting gold-braided oriental shoes, a yellow coat and a tall sheepskin cap pushed back from his forehead. Fastened to the silver strap that lay across his chest and back, he carried a powder-flask and a pistol behind him. Another pistol and a silver-mounted dagger hung from bis girdle, and above these a sword in a red-leather sheath and a musket in a black cover, were swung over his shoulder. By his clothing, by the way he sat his horse, by his general bearing, in fact by his every movement, one could see that he tried to resemble a Tartar. He even talked in a language I did not know, to the Tartars with whom he was riding, but from the bewildered and amused looks with which they glanced at one another, I surmised that they did not understand him either. He was one of our young officers, dare-devil braves who shape their lives on the model of Lermontov’s and Marlinsky’s heroes. These officers see the Caucasus only through the prism of such books as the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Heroes of our Times</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Mullah-Nur</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a>, and are guided in their actions not by their own inclinations, but by the examples of their models.</p>
				<p>The lieutenant, for instance, may perhaps have liked the company of well-bred women and of men of rank: generals, colonels, and aides-de-camp (it is even my conviction that he liked such society very much, for he was exceedingly ambitious), but he considered it his imperative duty to turn his roughest side to all important men, though he was strictly moderate in his rudeness to them; and when any lady came to the fortress, he considered it his duty to walk with his bosom-friends in a red shirt, and with slippers on his bare feet, before her window and to shout and swear at the top of his voice.</p>
				<p>But all this he did not so much with the intention of offending her, as to let her see what beautiful white feet he had, and how easy it would be to fall in love with him, should he desire it. Or he would often go with two or three friendly Tartars to the hills at night, to lie in ambush by the roadside, and to watch for passing hostile Tartars and to kill them: and though his heart told him more than once that there was nothing valiant in this, he considered himself bound to cause suffering to people, with whom he affected to be disillusioned, and whom he chose to hate and despise. He always carried two things: a large icon hanging round his neck, and a dagger which he wore over his shirt even when in bed. He sincerely believed that he had enemies. To persuade himself that he must avenge himself on some one and wash away some insult with blood was his greatest enjoyment. He was convinced that hatred, vengeance, and contempt for the human race, were the noblest and most poetic of feelings. But his mistress (a Circassian, of course) whom I happened to meet subsequently, used to say that he was the kindest and mildest of men, and that every evening he wrote down his dismal thoughts in his diary, as well as his accounts on ruled paper, and prayed to God on his knees. And how much he suffered, merely to appear in his own eyes what he wished to be! For his comrades and the soldiers could never see him as he wished to appear. Once, on one of his nocturnal expeditions on the road with his bosom friends, he happened to wound a hostile Chechen with a bullet in the leg, and took him prisoner. After that, the Chechen lived for seven weeks with the lieutenant, who attended to him and nursed him as he would have nursed his dearest friend; and when the Chechen recovered he gave him presents and set him free.</p>
				<p>After that, during one of our expeditions, when the lieutenant was retreating with the soldiers of the cordon and was firing to keep back the foe, he heard some one among the enemy call him by name, and the man he had wounded rode forward and made signs to the lieutenant to do the same.</p>
				<p>The lieutenant rode up to his friend and pressed his hand. The hillsmen stood some way back and did not fire, but scarcely had the lieutenant turned his horse to return, before several men shot at him and a bullet grazed the small of his back. Another time, at night, when a fire had broken out in the fortress and two companies of soldiers were putting it out, I myself saw how the tall figure of a man, mounted on a black horse, and lit up by the red glow of the fire, suddenly appeared among the crowd and, pushing through, rode up to the very flames. When quite close, the lieutenant jumped from his horse and rushed into the house, one side of which was burning. Five minutes later he came out, with singed hair and burned elbow, carrying in his bosom two pigeons which he had rescued from the flames.</p>
				<p>His name was Rosenkranz; yet he often spoke of his descent, deducing it somehow from the Varangians (the first rulers of Russia), and clearly demonstrated that he and his ancestors were pure Russians.</p>
