				<h3 epub:type="subtitle">A Story</h3>
			</hgroup>
			<p>Early in the nineteenth century, in the days when there were no railways or macadamised roads, no gas-light, no stearine candles, no low couches with spring cushions, no unvarnished furniture, no disillusioned youths with eye-glasses, no liberal women-philosophers, nor any charming <i xml:lang="fr">dames aux caméllias</i>, of whom there are so many in our times; in those naïve days, when leaving Moscow for Petersburg in a coach or carriage provided with a kitchenful of home-made provisions, one travelled for eight days along a soft, dusty, or muddy road, and had faith in chopped cutlets, in sleigh-bells and plain rolls; when in the long autumn evenings the tallow candles, around which family groups of twenty or thirty people gathered, had to be snuffed; when ballrooms were illuminated by candelabra with wax or spermaceti candles; when furniture was arranged symmetrically; when our fathers were still young, and proved it not only by the absence of wrinkles and grey hair, but by fighting duels for the sake of a woman and by rushing from the opposite corner of a room to pick up a bit of a handkerchief dropped purposely or accidentally; when our mothers wore short-waisted dresses and enormous sleeves, and decided family affairs by casting lots; when the charming <i xml:lang="fr">dames aux caméllias</i> hid from the light of day—in the naïve days of Freemasons' lodges,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-178" id="noteref-178" epub:type="noteref">178</a> Martinists,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-179" id="noteref-179" epub:type="noteref">179</a> and Tugendbunds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-180" id="noteref-180" epub:type="noteref">180</a> the days of Milorádovitches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-181" id="noteref-181" epub:type="noteref">181</a> and Davídofs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-182" id="noteref-182" epub:type="noteref">182</a> and Poúshkins—a meeting of landed proprietors was held at the Government town of K⸺ and the nobility<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-183" id="noteref-183" epub:type="noteref">183</a> elections were over.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">I</h3>
				<p>“Well, never mind, the saloon will do,” said a young officer wearing a fur cloak and hussar's cap, who had just got out of a post-sledge and was entering the best hotel in the town of K⸺.</p>
				<p>"The meeting, your excellency, is enormous," said the boots, who had already managed to learn from the Orderly that the hussar's name was Count Toúrbin, and therefore addressed him as “your excellency."</p>
				<p>“The proprietress of Afrémovo with her daughters has said she will leave this evening, so No. 11 will be at your disposal as soon as they go," continued the boots, stepping softly before the Count along the passage, and continually looking back.</p>
				<p>In the general saloon, at a little table under the blackened full-length portrait of the Emperor Alexander <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, several men, probably belonging to the local nobility, sat drinking champagne, and at one side sat some travellers: tradesmen in blue, fur-lined cloaks.</p>
				<p>Entering the room and calling in Blücher, a gigantic grey mastiff he had brought with him, the Count threw off his cloak, the collar of which was still covered with hoar-frost, called for <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i>, sat down in his blue satin Cossack jacket at the table, and entered into conversation with the gentlemen sitting there.</p>
				<p>The handsome, open countenance of the new-comer immediately predisposed them in his favour, and they offered him a glass of champagne. The Count first drank a glass of <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i>, and then ordered another bottle of champagne to treat his new acquaintances. The sledge-driver came in to ask for a tip.</p>
				<p>“Sáshka!” shouted the Count, “give him something."</p>
				<p>The driver went out with Sáshka, but came back again with the money in his hand.</p>
				<p>“Look here, y'r 'xelence, haven't I done my very best for y'r honour? Didn't you promise me half a rouble, and he's only given me a quarter!"</p>
				<p>"Sáshka, give him a rouble.”</p>
				<p>Sáshka cast down his eyes and looked at the driver's feet.</p>
				<p>“He's had enough!” he said, in a bass voice. "And besides, I have no more money.”</p>
				<p>The Count drew from his pocket-book the two five-rouble notes which were all that was in it, and gave one of them to the driver, who kissed his hand and went off.</p>
				<p>“I've run it pretty close!” said the Count. "These are my last five roubles.”</p>
				<p>“Real hussar fashion, Count,” said one of the nobles, who from his moustache, voice, and a certain energetic freedom about the legs, was evidently a retired cavalryman. "Are you staying here some time, Count?”</p>
				<p>“I must get some money. I should not have stayed here at all but for that. And there are no rooms to be had, devil take them, in this cursed pub."</p>
				<p>“Permit me, Count,” said the cavalryman, “will you not join me? My room is No. 7.... If you do not mind, just for the night. And then you'll stay a couple of days with us? It happens that the <i xml:lang="fr">Maréchal de la Noblesse</i> is just giving a ball to-night. You would make him very happy by going."</p>
				<p>“Yes, Count, do stay,” said another, a handsome young man. “You have surely no reason to hurry away! You know this only comes once in three years—the elections, I mean. You should at least have a look at our young ladies, Count!”</p>
				<p>“Sáshka, get my clean linen ready; I am going to the bath,” said the Count, rising, "and from there perhaps I may run in to the Marshal's.”</p>
				<p>Then, having called the waiter and whispered something to him, to which the latter answered with a smile, “That can all be managed,” he went out.</p>
				<p>“So I'll order my trunk to be taken to your room, old fellow,” shouted the Count from the passage.</p>
				<p>“Please do, I shall be most happy,” replied the cavalryman, running to the door; “No. 7—don't forget."</p>
				<p>When the Count's footsteps could no longer be heard, the cavalryman returned to his place, and sitting close to one of the group, a Government official, and looking him straight in the face with smiling eyes, he said—</p>
				<p>“It is the very man, you know.”</p>
				<p>“No?”</p>
				<p>“I tell you it is; it is the very same duellist hussar—the famous Toúrbin. He knew me—I bet you anything he knew me. Why, he and I went on the spree for three weeks without a break when I was at Lebedyáni<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-184" id="noteref-184" epub:type="noteref">184</a> for remounts. There was one thing—he and I did together.... He's a fine fellow, eh?”</p>
				<p>“A splendid fellow. And so pleasant in his manner! Doesn't show a grain of—what d’you call it?” answered the handsome young man. “How quickly we became intimate.... He's not more than twenty-five, is he?”</p>
				<p>“Oh no, that's what he looks, but he is more than that. One has to get to know him, you know. Who eloped with Migoúnova? He. It was he killed Sáblin. It was he dropped Matnyóf out of the window by the legs. He won 300,000 roubles of Prince Néstorof. He is a regular dare-devil, you know: a gambler, a duellist, a seducer, but a jewel of an hussar—a real jewel. The rumours that are afloat about us are nothing—if any one knew what a true hussar is! Ah yes, those were times!”</p>
				<p>And the cavalryman told his interlocutor of such a spree with the Count in Lebedyáni, as not only never had, but never even could have taken place.</p>
				<p>It could not have done so, first because he had never seen the Count till that day, and had left the army two years before the Count entered it; and secondly, because the cavalryman had never really served in the cavalry at all, but had for four years been the humblest of cadets in the Beléfsky Regiment, and had retired as soon as ever he became ensign. But ten years ago he had inherited some money and had really been in Lebedyáni, where he squandered 700 roubles with some officers who were there for remounts. He had even gone so far as to have an Uhlan uniform with orange facings made, meaning to enter an Uhlan regiment. This desire to enter the cavalry, and the three weeks spent with the remount officers at Lebedyáni, remained the brightest and happiest memories of his life; so that he transformed the desire, first into a reality and then into a reminiscence, and came to believe firmly in his past as a cavalry officer—all of which did not hinder him from being, both as to gentleness and honesty, a most worthy man.</p>
				<p>“Yes, those who have never served in the cavalry will never understand us fellows."</p>
				<p>He sat down astride a chair, and thrusting out his lower jaw began to speak in a bass voice. “One used to ride at the head of one's squadron: under you not a horse, but the devil incarnate, prancing all about, and you just sit in devil-me-care style. The squadron commander rides up to review: 'Lieutenant,' he says, 'if you please, we can't get on without you—lead the squadron to parade.' 'All right,' you say, and there you are; you turn round, shout to your moustached fellows.... Ah, devil take it, those were times!”</p>
				<p>The Count returned from the bath very red and with wet hair, and went straight to No.7, where the cavalryman was already sitting in his dressing-gown, smoking a pipe and considering with pleasure, and not without some apprehension, the happiness that had befallen him of sharing a room with the celebrated Toúrbin. "Now, supposing,” he thought, “that he suddenly takes me, strips me naked, drives with me to the town gates and puts me in the snow, or... tars me, or simply... But no,” he consoled himself, “he won't do it to a comrade.”</p>
				<p>"Sáshka, feed Blücher!” shouted the Count.</p>
				<p>Sáshka, who had taken a tumbler of <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i> to refresh himself after the journey, and was decidedly tipsy, came in.</p>
				<p>“What, already! You've been drinking, rascal!... Feed Blücher!”</p>
				<p>“He won't starve anyhow; see how sleek he is!” answered Sáshka, stroking the dog.</p>
				<p>"Silence! Be off and feed him!”</p>
				<p>“You want the dog to be fed, but when a man drinks a glass you reproach him."</p>
				<p>"Hey! I'll thrash you!” shouted the Count, in a voice that made the window panes rattle and frightened even the cavalryman a bit.</p>
				<p>“You should ask if Sáshka has yet had a bite today! Yes, beat me, if you think more of a dog than of a man,” muttered Sáshka.</p>
				<p>But here he received such a terrible blow in the face from the Count's fist, that he fell, knocked his head against the partition, and, clutching his nose, fled from the room and fell on a settee in the passage.</p>
				<p>“He's knocked my teeth out," grunted Sáshka, wiping his bleeding nose with one hand, while with the other he scratched the back of Blücher, who was licking himself. “He's knocked my teeth out, Bluchy, but still he's my Count, and I'd go through fire for him—I would! Because he—is my Count; do you understand, Bluchy? Want your dinner, eh?”</p>
				<p>After lying still for a while, he rose, fed the dog, and then, almost sobered, went in to wait on his Count, and to offer him some tea.</p>
				<p>“I shall really feel hurt,” said the cavalryman meekly, as he stood before the Count, who was lying on the cavalryman's bed with his legs up against the partition. “You see, I also am an old army man, and, I may say, a comrade. Why should you borrow from any one else when I shall be delighted to lend you a couple of hundred roubles? I have not got them just now, only a hundred roubles, but I'll get the rest to-day. You would really hurt my feelings, Count!”</p>
				<p>“Thank you, old man,” said the Count, instantly discerning what kind of relations had to be established between them, and slapping the cavalryman on the shoulder: “Thanks! Well then, we'll go to the ball if it must be so. But what are we to do now? Tell us what you have in your town. What pretty girls? What men game for a spree? What gaming?”</p>
				<p>The cavalryman explained that there would be an abundance of pretty creatures at the ball, that Kólhof, who had been re-elected Captain of Police, was the best hand at a spree, only he lacked the true hussar go—otherwise he was a good sort of chap; that the Ilúshkin gipsy chorus had been singing in the town since the elections began, Styóshka leading, and that everybody meant to go to hear them after leaving the Marshal's that evening.</p>
				<p>"And there is a devilish lot of card-playing too," he went on; “Loúhnof plays. He has money and is staying here to break his journey, and Ilyín, an Uhlan cornet, who has room No. 8, has lost a lot. They have already begun in his room. They play every evening. And what a fine fellow that Ilyín is! I tell you, Count, he's not mean—he'll let his last shirt go.”</p>
				<p>"Well then, let us go to his room. Let us see what sort of people they are," said the Count.</p>
				<p>“Yes, do, pray do. They will be devilish glad."</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>
				<p>The Uhlan cornet, Ilyín, had not been long awake. The evening before he had sat down to cards at eight o'clock, and had lost pretty steadily for fifteen hours on end—till eleven in the morning. He had lost a considerable sum, but did not know exactly how much, because he had about 3000 roubles of his own, and 15,000 service-money which had long since got mixed up with it, and he feared to count lest he should find his forebodings confirmed that some of the Government money was already missing. It was nearly noon when he fell asleep, and he had slept that heavy, dreamless sleep which comes only to a very young man, and after a heavy loss. Waking at six o'clock (just at the time when Count Toúrbin arrived at the hotel), and seeing the floor all around strewn with cards and bits of chalk, and the chalk-marked tables in the middle of the room, he recalled with terror last night's play, and the last card, a knave on which he lost 500 roubles; but not yet quite convinced of the reality of all this, he drew his money from under his pillow and began to count. He recognised some notes which had passed from hand to hand several times with 'corners' and 'transports,' and he recollected the whole course of the game. He had none of his own 3000 roubles left, and some 2500 Government money were also gone.</p>
				<p>The Uhlan had been playing for four nights running.</p>
				<p>He had come from Moscow, where the service-money had been entrusted to him, and he had been detained at K⸺ by the superintendent of the post-house on the pretext that there were no horses, but really because the latter had an agreement with the hotel keeper to detain all travellers a day. The Uhlan, a bright young lad, who had just received 3000 roubles from his parents in Moscow for his equipment on entering his regiment, was glad to spend a few days in the town of K⸺ at election time, and hoped to thoroughly enjoy himself. He knew one of the landed gentry there who had a family, and he was thinking of looking them up and flirting with the daughters, when the cavalryman turned up to make his acquaintance. That same evening, without any evil intent, the cavalryman introduced him to his other acquaintances, Loúhnof and other gamblers, in the general saloon, or common room, of the hotel. And ever since then the Uhlan had been playing cards, not asking at the station for horses, much less going to visit his acquaintance the landed proprietor, and not even leaving his room for four days.</p>
				<p>Having dressed and had some tea, he went to the window. He felt he would like to go for a stroll, to get rid of the gaming recollections that haunted him. He put on his cloak and went out into the street. The sun was already hidden behind the white, red-roofed houses, and it was getting dusk. It was warm for winter. Large, wet snowflakes were slowly falling into the muddy street. Suddenly, at the thought that he had slept all through the day now ending, a feeling of intolerable sadness came over him.</p>
				<p>“This day, now past, can never be brought back," he thought.</p>
				<p>“I have ruined my youth!” he suddenly said to himself, not because he really thought he had ruined his youth—he did not even think about it—but the phrase just happened to come into his head.</p>
				<p>“And what am I to do now?” thought he: “borrow of some one and go away?” A lady passed him along the pavement. “There's a stupid woman," thought he, for some unknown reason. “There's no one to borrow of... I have ruined my youth!” He came to the bazaar. A tradesman in a fox-fur cloak stood at the door of his shop touting for customers. “If I had not taken that eight I should have recovered my losses.” An old beggar-woman followed him whimpering. "There's no one to borrow from.” Some man or other drove past in a bearskin cloak; a policeman was standing at his post. “What could one do that is unusual? Shoot at them? No, it's dull.... I have ruined my youth!... Ah, there are fine horse-collars and trappings hanging there. There now, if one could get into a tróyka:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-185" id="noteref-185" epub:type="noteref">185</a> 'Gee-up, beauties!'... I'll go back. Loúhnof will come soon, and we'll play.”</p>
				<p>He returned to the hotel and again counted his money. No, he had made no mistake when he first counted: there were still 2500 roubles of Government money missing. “I'll stake 25 roubles on the first card, then make a 'corner'... 7-fold it, 15-fold, 30, 60... 3000 roubles. Then I'll buy the horse-collars and be off. He won't give me a chance, the rascal! I have ruined my youth!”</p>
				<p>That is what was going on in the Uhlan's head when Loúhnof really entered the room.</p>
				<p>“Well, have you been up long, Michael Vasílitch?” asked Loúhnof, slowly removing the gold spectacles from his skinny nose, and carefully wiping them with a red silk handkerchief.</p>
				<p>“No, I've only just got up—I slept uncommonly well.”</p>
				<p>“Some hussar or other has arrived; he is staying with Zavalshévsky—did you know? "</p>
				<p>“No, I didn't. But how's it no one else has turned up?”</p>
				<p>“They must have gone into Pryáhin's. They'll be here directly."</p>
				<p>And, sure enough, a little later the room was entered by a garrison officer who always followed Loúhnof, a Greek merchant with an enormous brown, hooked nose and sunken black eyes, and a fat, puffy squire and distiller, who played whole nights, always staking 'simples' of half-a-rouble each.</p>
				<p>They all wished to begin playing as soon as possible, but the principal players, and especially Loúhnof, who was telling about a robbery in Moscow in an exceedingly calm manner, said nothing about that subject.</p>
				<p>“Just fancy," he said, "a city like Moscow, the historic capital, the chief town, and men go about there with crooks, dressed up like devils, frighten stupid people and rob the passers-by,—and there's an end of it. What are the police about? That's the question."</p>
				<p>The Uhlan listened attentively to the story about the robbers, but when a pause came he rose and quietly ordered cards to be brought. The fat squire was the first to speak out.</p>
				<p>“I say, gentlemen, why lose precious time? If we mean business, let us begin.”</p>
				<p>"Yes, you walked off with a pile of half-roubles last night, so you like it,” said the Greek.</p>
				<p>“It is about time,” said the garrison officer.</p>
				<p>Ilyín looked at Loúhnof. Loúhnof, looking him straight in the eyes, quietly continued his story about robbers dressed up as devils with claws.</p>
				<p>“Will you take the bank?” asked the Uhlan.</p>
				<p>“Is it not too early?”</p>
				<p>“Belóf!” shouted the Uhlan, blushing for some unknown reason, "bring me some dinner—I have not had anything to eat yet, gentlemen—and a bottle of champagne and some cards.</p>
				<p>At this moment the Count and Zavalshévsky entered. It turned out that Toúrbin and Ilyín belonged to the same division. They took to one another at once, clinked glasses, drank champagne together, and were on intimate terms in five minutes. The Count seemed to like Ilyín very much; he looked smilingly at him and teased him about his youthfulness.</p>
				<p>“There's an Uhlan of the true sort!” said he. “What moustaches,—dear me, what moustaches!”</p>
				<p>Even what little fluff there was on Ilyín's lip was quite white.</p>
				<p>"I suppose you are going to play? " said the Count: “Well, I wish you luck, Ilyín! I should think you are a master at it,” he added, with a smile.</p>
				<p>“Yes, they mean to start,” said Loúhnof, tearing open a pack of cards, “and you, Count, won't you join us?"</p>
				<p>“No, not to-day. I should clear you all out if I did. When I begin 'cornering' in earnest the bank begins to crack! But I have nothing to play with–I was cleaned out at a station near Volotchók. I met some infantry fellow there with rings on his fingers—some sharper, I should think—and he plucked me clean."</p>
				<p>"Why, how long were you at that station?" asked Ilyín.</p>
				<p>“I sat there for twenty-two hours. I shall remember that cursed station! And the superintendent won't forget me either..."</p>
				<p>“How's that?”</p>
				<p>“I drive up, you know; out rushes the superintendent, with a regular brigand's rascally phiz. 'No horses,' says he. Now, I must tell you, I make it a rule: if there are no horses I don't take off my cloak, but go into the superintendent's own room—not into the public room, but into his private room—and I have all the doors and windows opened, on the ground that it's smoky. Well, that's just what I did there. And you remember what frosts we had last week? Twenty degrees!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-186" id="noteref-186" epub:type="noteref">186</a> The superintendent began to reason, I punched his head. There was an old woman there, girls and women; they kicked up a row, caught up their pots and pans and were rushing off to the village... I went to the door, and said, 'Let me have horses and I'll be off; if not, no one shall go out: I'll freeze you all!'”</p>
				<p>“That's an infernally good plan!” said the puffy squire, rolling with laughter; "it's the way they freeze out cockroaches..."</p>
				<p>“But I did not watch carefully, and the superintendent made off with all the women. Only one old woman remained in pawn on the top of the stove; she kept sneezing and saying her prayers. Afterwards we began negotiating; the superintendent came and, from a distance, began persuading me to let the old woman go, but I set Blücher at him a bit. Blücher's splendid at tackling superintendents! But the rascal did not let me have horses until the next morning. Then that infantry fellow came along. I joined him in the other room, and we began to play. You have seen Blücher?... Blücher!... Whew!”</p>
				<p>Blücher rushed in. The players condescendingly paid him some attention, though it was evident they wished to attend to quite other matters.</p>
				<p>“But why don't you play, gentlemen? Please don't let me prevent you. I am a chatterbox, you see," said Toúrbin. Play is play, whether one likes it or not."</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
				<p>Loúhnof drew two candles nearer to himself, took out a large brown pocket-book full of paper money, and slowly, as if performing some rite, opened it on the table, drew forth two hundred-rouble notes and put them under the cards.</p>
				<p>“Two hundred for the bank, the same as yesterday,” said he, arranging his spectacles and opening a pack of cards.</p>
				<p>“Very well,” said Ilyín, continuing his conversation with Toúrbin without looking at Loúhnof.</p>
				<p>The game<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-187" id="noteref-187" epub:type="noteref">187</a> started. Loúhnof dealt the cards with machine-like precision, stopping now and then and deliberately jotting something down, or looking severely over his spectacles and saying in low tones, “Pass up!” The fat squire spoke louder than any one else, audibly deliberating with himself, and wetting his plump fingers as he bent down the corners of the cards. The garrison officer silently and neatly noted the amount of his stake on his card, and bent down small corners under the table. The Greek sat beside the 'banker' and watched the game attentively with his black, sunken eyes, and seemed to be waiting for something. Zavalshévsky, standing by the table, would suddenly begin to fidget all over, take a red or blue bank-note<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-188" id="noteref-188" epub:type="noteref">188</a> out of his trousers pocket, lay a card on it, slap it with his palm and say, "Little seven, pull me through!” Then he would bite his moustache, step from foot to foot, and keep fidgeting until his card was dealt. Ilyín sat eating veal and cucumbers, which were placed beside him on the horsehair sofa, and, hastily wiping his hands on his coat, laid down card after card. Toúrbin, who at first sat on the sofa, quickly saw how things stood. Loúhnof did not look at or speak to the Uhlan; only now and then his spectacles would turn for a moment towards the Uhlan's hand, but most of the latter's cards lost.</p>
				<p>“There, now, I should like to beat that card,” said Loúhnof of a card the fat squire, who was staking half-roubles, had put down.</p>
				<p>“You beat Ilyín's, never mind me!” remarked the squire.</p>
				<p>And, really, Ilyín's cards lost more often than any of the others. He would tear up the losing card nervously under the table, and choose another with trembling fingers. Toúrbin rose from the sofa and asked the Greek to let him sit by the 'banker.' The Greek moved to another place and gave his chair to the Count, who began watching Loúhnof's hands attentively, not taking his eyes off them.</p>
				<p>“Ilyín!” he suddenly said, in his usual voice, which quite unintentionally drowned all others, “why do you repeat the same card? You don't know how to play.”</p>
				<p>“It's all the same how one plays.”</p>
				<p>“That way you'll be sure to lose. Let me play for you."</p>
				<p>“No, please excuse me. I always do it myself. Play for yourself if you like."</p>
				<p>“I said I should not play for myself, but I should like to play for you. I am vexed that you are losing.”</p>
				<p>"I suppose it's my fate.”</p>
				<p>The Count was silent, but putting his elbows on the table, again gazed intently at the 'banker's' hands.</p>
				<p>“Abominable!” he suddenly said, in a loud, long-drawn tone.</p>
				<p>Loúhnof glanced at him.</p>
				<p>“Abominable, quite abominable!” he repeated, still louder, looking straight into Loúhnof's eyes.</p>
				<p>The game continued.</p>
				<p>“Very bad!” again said Toúrbin, just as Loúhnof 'beat' a large card of Ilyín's.</p>
				<p>“What is it you don't like, Count?" inquired the 'banker,' with polite indifference.</p>
				<p>"This!—that you let Ilyín have his 'simples,' and beat his 'corners.' That's what is bad.”</p>
				<p>Loúhnof made a slight movement with his brows and shoulders, expressing the advisability of submitting to fate in everything, and continued to play.</p>
				<p>“Blücher! Whew!” shouted the Count, rising. “At him!” he added quickly.</p>
				<p>Blücher, bumping his back against the sofa as he leapt from under it and nearly knocking the garrison officer over, ran to his master and growled, looking round on every one and moving his tail as if asking, “Who is misbehaving here, eh?”</p>
				<p>Loúhnof laid down his cards and moved to one side with his chair.</p>
				<p>“One can't play like that,” he said. “I hate dogs. What kind of game is it when one brings in a whole pack of hounds?”</p>
				<p>“And especially dogs like that. I believe they are called 'leeches,'” chimed in the garrison officer.</p>
				<p>“Well, are we going to play or not, Michael Vasílitch?” said Loúhnof to their host.</p>
				<p>“Please don't interfere with us, Count,” said Ilyín, turning to Toúrbin.</p>
				<p>“Come here a minute," said Toúrbin, taking Ilyín's arm and stepping behind the partition with him.</p>
				<p>The Count's words, spoken in his usual tone, were distinctly audible from there. His voice always carried across three rooms.</p>
				<p>“Are you daft, eh? Don't you see that gentleman in spectacles is a sharper of the first water?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, enough! What are you saying?”</p>
				<p>“No enough about it! Just stop, I tell you. It's nothing to me. Another time I'd pluck you myself, but somehow I'm sorry you should be fleeced. And maybe you have service-money too?”</p>
				<p>“No... why do you invent such things?”</p>
				<p>“Eh, my lad, I've been that way myself, so I know all those sharpers' tricks. I tell you the chap with the spectacles is a sharper. Stop now! I ask you as a comrade.”</p>
				<p>“Well then, I'll only finish this one deal.”</p>
				<p>"I know what 'one deal' means. Well, we'll see.”</p>
				<p>They went back. In this one deal Ilyín put down so many cards, and so many of them were beaten, that he lost a large sum.</p>
				<p>Toúrbin put his hands in the middle of the table. “Now stop it! Come along.”</p>
				<p>“No, I can't. Leave me alone, do!” said Ilyín, irritably shuffling some bent cards without looking at Toúrbin.</p>
				<p>“Well, go to the devil! Go and lose for certain, if that pleases you; it's time for me to be off. Zavalshévsky, let's go to the Marshal's."</p>
				<p>They went out. All remained silent, and Loúhnof dealt no more cards until the sound of their steps and of Blücher's claws on the passage floor had died away.</p>
				<p>“What a devil of a fellow!” said the squire, laughing.</p>
				<p>“Well, he'll not interfere now,” remarked the garrison officer hastily and still in a whisper.</p>
				<p>And the play continued.</p>
