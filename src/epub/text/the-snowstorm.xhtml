				<p>It was past six o’clock in the evening, after drinking tea, that I set out from a posting-station, the name of which I have forgotten, though I remember that it was somewhere in the Don Cossack district, near Novotcherkask. It was quite dark as I wrapped myself in my fur cloak and fur rug and settled myself beside Alyoshka in the sledge. Under the lee of the station-house it seemed warm and still. Though there was no snow falling, there was not a star to be seen overhead, and the sky seemed extraordinarily low and black in contrast with the pure, snowy plain stretched out before us.</p>
				<p>As soon as we had driven out of the village, passing the dark figures of some windmills, one of which was clumsily waving its great sails, I noticed that the road was heavier and thicker with snow, and the wind began to blow more keenly on my left, tossed the horses’ tails and manes on one side, and persistently lifted and blew away the snow as it was stirred up by the sledge-runners and the horses’ hoofs. The tinkle of the bell died away, a draught of cold air made its way through some aperture in my sleeve and blew down my back, and I recalled the advice of the overseer of the station that I should do better not to start that night, or I might be out all night and get frozen on the way.</p>
				<p>'Don’t you think we might get lost?’ I said to the driver. But receiving no reply, I put the question more definitely, 'What do you say, shall we reach the next station? Shan’t we lose the way?’</p>
				<p>'God knows,’ he answered, without turning his head. 'How it drives along the ground! Can’t see the road a bit. Lord, ’a’ mercy!’</p>
				<p>‘Well, but you tell me, do you expect to get to the next station or not?’ I persisted in inquiring. 'Shall we manage to get there?’</p>
				<p>'We’ve got to get there,’ said the driver, and he said something more which I could not catch in the wind.</p>
				<p>I did not want to turn back; but to spend the night driving in the frost and the snow-storm about the absolutely desolate steppe of that part of the Don Cossack district was a very cheerless prospect. And although in the dark I could not see my driver distinctly, I somehow did not take to him, and felt no confidence in him. He was sitting with his legs hanging down before him exactly in the middle of his seat instead of on one side. His voice sounded listless; he wore a big hat with a wavering brim, not a coachman’s cap, and besides he did not drive in correct style, but held the reins in both hands, like a footman who has taken the coachman’s place on the box. And what prejudiced me most of all was that he had tied a kerchief over his ears. In short, the serious, bent back before my eyes impressed me unfavourably and seemed to promise no good.</p>
				<p>‘Well, I think it would be better to turn back,’ said Alyoshka; ‘it’s poor fun being lost.’</p>
				<p>‘Lord, ’a’ mercy! how the snow is flying; no chance of seeing the road; one’s eyes choked up entirely. . . . Lord, ’a’ mercy!’ grumbled the driver.</p>
				<p>We had not driven on another quarter of an hour, when the driver, pulling up the horses, handed the reins to Alyoshka, clumsily extricated his legs from the box, and walked off to look for the road, his big boots crunching in the snow.</p>
				<p>‘Where are you going? Are we off the road, eh?’ I inquired, but the driver did not answer. Turning his head to avoid the wind, which was cutting straight in his face, he walked away from the sledge.</p>
				<p>'Well, found it?’ I questioned him again, when he had come back.</p>
				<p>‘No, nothing,’ he said with sudden impatience and annoyance, as though I were to blame for his having got off the road, and deliberately tucking his big feet back again under the box, he picked up the reins with his frozen gloves.</p>
				<p>'What are we going to do?’ I asked, as we started again.</p>
				<p>'What are we to do? Go whither God leads us.’</p>
				<p>And we drove on at the same slow trot, unmistakably on no sort of road; at one moment in snow that was soft and deep, and the next over brittle, bare ice.</p>
				<p>Although it was so cold, the snow on my fur collar melted very quickly; the drifting snow blew more and more thickly near the ground, and a few flakes of frozen snow began falling overhead.</p>
				<p>It was evident that we were going astray, because after driving another quarter of an hour, we had not seen a single verst post.</p>
				<p>'Come, what do you think,’ I asked the driver again, 'can we manage to get to the station?’</p>
				<p>‘To which station? . . . We shall get back all right if we let the horses go as they please, they ’ll take us there; but I doubt our getting to the other station; only lose our lives, may be.’</p>
				<p>‘Well, then let us go back,’ said I. ‘And really . . .’</p>
				<p>‘Turn back then?’ repeated the driver.</p>
				<p>‘Yes, yes, turn back!’</p>
				<p>The driver let the reins go. The horses went at a better pace, and though I did not notice that we turned round, the wind changed and soon the mills could be seen through the snow. The driver plucked up his spirits and began talking. ‘The other day they were driving back from the next station like this in a snow-storm,’ said he, ‘and they spent the night in some stacks and only arrived next morning. And a good job they did get into the stacks, or they’d have all been clean frozen to death—it was a frost. As it was, one had his feet frost-bitten; and he died of it three weeks after.’</p>
				<p>'But now it’s not so cold and the wind seems dropping,’ said I; 'couldn’t we manage it?’</p>
				<p>'Warmer it may be, but the snow’s drifting just the same. Now it’s behind us, so it seems a bit quieter, but it’s blowing hard. We might have to go if we’d the mail or anything; but it’s a different matter going of our own accord; it’s no joke to let one’s fare freeze. What if I’ve to answer for your honour afterwards?’</p>

				<p>At that moment we heard the bells of several sledges behind us, overtaking us at a smart pace.</p>
				<p>‘It’s the mail express bell,’ said my driver; ‘there’s only one like that at the station.’</p>
				<p>And certainly the bells of the foremost sledge were particularly fine; their clear, rich, mellow and somewhat jangled notes reached us distinctly on the wind. As I learned afterwards, it was a set of bells such as sportsmen have on their sledges—three bells, a big one in the middle, with a ‘raspberry note,’ as it is called, and two little bells pitched at the interval of a third up and down the scale. The cadence of these thirds and the jangling fifth ringing in the air was uncommonly striking and strangely sweet in the desolate dumb steppe.</p>
				<p>‘It’s the post,’ said my driver, when the foremost of the three sledges was level with us. ‘How’s the road, can one get along?’ he shouted to the hindmost of the drivers; but the latter only shouted to his horses without answering him.</p>
				<p>The music of the bells quickly died away in the wind as soon as the post had passed us. I suppose my driver felt ashamed.</p>
				<p>‘Suppose we go on, sir!’ he said to me; ‘folks have driven along the road, and now their tracks will be fresh.’</p>
				<p>I assented and we turned, facing the wind again, and pushing on through the deep snow. I watched the road at the side, that we might not go off the tracks made by the sledges. For two versts their track was distinctly visible; then only a slight unevenness could be detected below the runners, and soon I was utterly unable to say whether there was a track or simply a crease blown by the wind in the snow. My eyes were dazed by watching the snow flying monotonously by under our runners, and I began looking straight before me. The third verst post we saw, but the fourth we could not find; just as before we drove against the wind and with the wind, to the right and to the left, and at last things came to such a pass that the driver said we were too much to the right; I said too much to the left; and Alyoshka maintained that we were going straight back. Again we pulled up several times, and the driver extricated his long legs and clambered out to seek the road, but always in vain. I, too, got out once to see whether something I fancied I descried might not be the road. But scarcely had I struggled six steps against the wind and satisfied myself that there was nothing but regular, uniform white drifts of snow everywhere, and that I had seen the road only in imagination, when I lost sight of the sledge. I shouted 'Driver! Alyoshka!' but my voice I felt was caught up by the wind out of my very mouth and in one second carried far away from me. I went in the direction where the sledge had been—there was no sledge there. I went to the right, it was not there. I am ashamed when I remember the loud, shrill, almost despairing, voice in which I shouted once more, ‘Driver!’ when he was only a couple of paces from me. His black figure, with his whip and his huge hat flapping down on one side, suddenly started up before me. He led me to the sledge.</p>
				<p>‘We must be thankful, too, that it’s warm,’ said he; ‘if the frost gets sharp, it’s a bad look-out. . . . Lord, ’a’ mercy!’</p>
				<p>‘Let the horses go, let them take us back,’ I said, settling myself in the sledge. ‘They’ll take us back, driver, eh?’</p>
				<p>‘They ought to.’</p>
				<p>He put down the reins, gave the shaft horse three strokes about the pad with his whip, and we started off again. We drove for another half-hour. All at once we heard ahead of us bells, which I recognised as the sportsman’s set of bells and two others. But this time the bells were coming to meet us. The same three sledges, having delivered the post, were returning to their station with their change of horses tied on behind. The three stalwart horses of the express sledge with the sporting bells galloped swiftly in front. There was only one driver in it. He was sitting on the box-seat, shouting briskly and frequently to his horses. Behind, in the inside of the emptied sledge, there were a couple of drivers; we could hear their loud, cheerful talk. One of them was smoking a pipe, and its spark, glowing in the wind, lighted up part of his face. Looking at them I felt ashamed of having been afraid to go on, and my driver must have had the same feeling, for with one voice we said, ‘Let us follow them.’</p>
