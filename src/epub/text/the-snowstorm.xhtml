				<p>It was past six o’clock in the evening, after drinking tea, that I set out from a posting-station, the name of which I have forgotten, though I remember that it was somewhere in the Don Cossack district, near Novotcherkask. It was quite dark as I wrapped myself in my fur cloak and fur rug and settled myself beside Alyoshka in the sledge. Under the lee of the station-house it seemed warm and still. Though there was no snow falling, there was not a star to be seen overhead, and the sky seemed extraordinarily low and black in contrast with the pure, snowy plain stretched out before us.</p>
				<p>As soon as we had driven out of the village, passing the dark figures of some windmills, one of which was clumsily waving its great sails, I noticed that the road was heavier and thicker with snow, and the wind began to blow more keenly on my left, tossed the horses’ tails and manes on one side, and persistently lifted and blew away the snow as it was stirred up by the sledge-runners and the horses’ hoofs. The tinkle of the bell died away, a draught of cold air made its way through some aperture in my sleeve and blew down my back, and I recalled the advice of the overseer of the station that I should do better not to start that night, or I might be out all night and get frozen on the way.</p>
				<p>'Don’t you think we might get lost?’ I said to the driver. But receiving no reply, I put the question more definitely, 'What do you say, shall we reach the next station? Shan’t we lose the way?’</p>
				<p>'God knows,’ he answered, without turning his head. 'How it drives along the ground! Can’t see the road a bit. Lord, ’a’ mercy!’</p>
				<p>‘Well, but you tell me, do you expect to get to the next station or not?’ I persisted in inquiring. 'Shall we manage to get there?’</p>
				<p>'We’ve got to get there,’ said the driver, and he said something more which I could not catch in the wind.</p>
				<p>I did not want to turn back; but to spend the night driving in the frost and the snow-storm about the absolutely desolate steppe of that part of the Don Cossack district was a very cheerless prospect. And although in the dark I could not see my driver distinctly, I somehow did not take to him, and felt no confidence in him. He was sitting with his legs hanging down before him exactly in the middle of his seat instead of on one side. His voice sounded listless; he wore a big hat with a wavering brim, not a coachman’s cap, and besides he did not drive in correct style, but held the reins in both hands, like a footman who has taken the coachman’s place on the box. And what prejudiced me most of all was that he had tied a kerchief over his ears. In short, the serious, bent back before my eyes impressed me unfavourably and seemed to promise no good.</p>
				<p>‘Well, I think it would be better to turn back,’ said Alyoshka; ‘it’s poor fun being lost.’</p>
				<p>‘Lord, ’a’ mercy! how the snow is flying; no chance of seeing the road; one’s eyes choked up entirely. . . . Lord, ’a’ mercy!’ grumbled the driver.</p>
				<p>We had not driven on another quarter of an hour, when the driver, pulling up the horses, handed the reins to Alyoshka, clumsily extricated his legs from the box, and walked off to look for the road, his big boots crunching in the snow.</p>
				<p>‘Where are you going? Are we off the road, eh?’ I inquired, but the driver did not answer. Turning his head to avoid the wind, which was cutting straight in his face, he walked away from the sledge.</p>
				<p>'Well, found it?’ I questioned him again, when he had come back.</p>
				<p>‘No, nothing,’ he said with sudden impatience and annoyance, as though I were to blame for his having got off the road, and deliberately tucking his big feet back again under the box, he picked up the reins with his frozen gloves.</p>
				<p>'What are we going to do?’ I asked, as we started again.</p>
				<p>'What are we to do? Go whither God leads us.’</p>
				<p>And we drove on at the same slow trot, unmistakably on no sort of road; at one moment in snow that was soft and deep, and the next over brittle, bare ice.</p>
				<p>Although it was so cold, the snow on my fur collar melted very quickly; the drifting snow blew more and more thickly near the ground, and a few flakes of frozen snow began falling overhead.</p>
				<p>It was evident that we were going astray, because after driving another quarter of an hour, we had not seen a single verst post.</p>
				<p>'Come, what do you think,’ I asked the driver again, 'can we manage to get to the station?’</p>
				<p>‘To which station? . . . We shall get back all right if we let the horses go as they please, they ’ll take us there; but I doubt our getting to the other station; only lose our lives, may be.’</p>
				<p>‘Well, then let us go back,’ said I. ‘And really . . .’</p>
				<p>‘Turn back then?’ repeated the driver.</p>
				<p>‘Yes, yes, turn back!’</p>
				<p>The driver let the reins go. The horses went at a better pace, and though I did not notice that we turned round, the wind changed and soon the mills could be seen through the snow. The driver plucked up his spirits and began talking. ‘The other day they were driving back from the next station like this in a snow-storm,’ said he, ‘and they spent the night in some stacks and only arrived next morning. And a good job they did get into the stacks, or they’d have all been clean frozen to death—it was a frost. As it was, one had his feet frost-bitten; and he died of it three weeks after.’</p>
				<p>'But now it’s not so cold and the wind seems dropping,’ said I; 'couldn’t we manage it?’</p>
				<p>'Warmer it may be, but the snow’s drifting just the same. Now it’s behind us, so it seems a bit quieter, but it’s blowing hard. We might have to go if we’d the mail or anything; but it’s a different matter going of our own accord; it’s no joke to let one’s fare freeze. What if I’ve to answer for your honour afterwards?’</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>
				<p>At that moment we heard the bells of several sledges behind us, overtaking us at a smart pace.</p>
				<p>‘It’s the mail express bell,’ said my driver; ‘there’s only one like that at the station.’</p>
				<p>And certainly the bells of the foremost sledge were particularly fine; their clear, rich, mellow and somewhat jangled notes reached us distinctly on the wind. As I learned afterwards, it was a set of bells such as sportsmen have on their sledges—three bells, a big one in the middle, with a ‘raspberry note,’ as it is called, and two little bells pitched at the interval of a third up and down the scale. The cadence of these thirds and the jangling fifth ringing in the air was uncommonly striking and strangely sweet in the desolate dumb steppe.</p>
				<p>‘It’s the post,’ said my driver, when the foremost of the three sledges was level with us. ‘How’s the road, can one get along?’ he shouted to the hindmost of the drivers; but the latter only shouted to his horses without answering him.</p>
				<p>The music of the bells quickly died away in the wind as soon as the post had passed us. I suppose my driver felt ashamed.</p>
				<p>‘Suppose we go on, sir!’ he said to me; ‘folks have driven along the road, and now their tracks will be fresh.’</p>
				<p>I assented and we turned, facing the wind again, and pushing on through the deep snow. I watched the road at the side, that we might not go off the tracks made by the sledges. For two versts their track was distinctly visible; then only a slight unevenness could be detected below the runners, and soon I was utterly unable to say whether there was a track or simply a crease blown by the wind in the snow. My eyes were dazed by watching the snow flying monotonously by under our runners, and I began looking straight before me. The third verst post we saw, but the fourth we could not find; just as before we drove against the wind and with the wind, to the right and to the left, and at last things came to such a pass that the driver said we were too much to the right; I said too much to the left; and Alyoshka maintained that we were going straight back. Again we pulled up several times, and the driver extricated his long legs and clambered out to seek the road, but always in vain. I, too, got out once to see whether something I fancied I descried might not be the road. But scarcely had I struggled six steps against the wind and satisfied myself that there was nothing but regular, uniform white drifts of snow everywhere, and that I had seen the road only in imagination, when I lost sight of the sledge. I shouted 'Driver! Alyoshka!' but my voice I felt was caught up by the wind out of my very mouth and in one second carried far away from me. I went in the direction where the sledge had been—there was no sledge there. I went to the right, it was not there. I am ashamed when I remember the loud, shrill, almost despairing, voice in which I shouted once more, ‘Driver!’ when he was only a couple of paces from me. His black figure, with his whip and his huge hat flapping down on one side, suddenly started up before me. He led me to the sledge.</p>
				<p>‘We must be thankful, too, that it’s warm,’ said he; ‘if the frost gets sharp, it’s a bad look-out. . . . Lord, ’a’ mercy!’</p>
				<p>‘Let the horses go, let them take us back,’ I said, settling myself in the sledge. ‘They’ll take us back, driver, eh?’</p>
				<p>‘They ought to.’</p>
				<p>He put down the reins, gave the shaft horse three strokes about the pad with his whip, and we started off again. We drove for another half-hour. All at once we heard ahead of us bells, which I recognised as the sportsman’s set of bells and two others. But this time the bells were coming to meet us. The same three sledges, having delivered the post, were returning to their station with their change of horses tied on behind. The three stalwart horses of the express sledge with the sporting bells galloped swiftly in front. There was only one driver in it. He was sitting on the box-seat, shouting briskly and frequently to his horses. Behind, in the inside of the emptied sledge, there were a couple of drivers; we could hear their loud, cheerful talk. One of them was smoking a pipe, and its spark, glowing in the wind, lighted up part of his face. Looking at them I felt ashamed of having been afraid to go on, and my driver must have had the same feeling, for with one voice we said, ‘Let us follow them.’</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
				<p>Without waiting for the hindmost sledge to get by, my driver began turning awkwardly and ran his shafts into the horses tied on at the back of it. One team of three started aside, broke their rein, and galloped away.</p>
				<p>'Ah, the cross-eyed devil doesn’t see where he’s turning to—right into people! . . . The devil!’ scolded a short driver in a husky, cracked voice—an old man, as I inferred from his voice and figure. He jumped nimbly out of the hindmost sledge and ran after the horses, still keeping up his coarse and cruel abuse of my driver.</p>
				<p>But the horses would not let themselves be caught. The old man ran after them, and in one moment horses and man vanished in the white darkness of the snow-storm.</p>
				<p>'Vassily—y! give us the bay here; there’s no catching them like this,’ we heard his voice again.</p>
				<p>One of the drivers, a very tall man, got out of the sledge, unyoked his three horses, pulled himself up by the head on to one of them, and crunching over the snow at a shuffling gallop vanished in the same direction.</p>
				<p>In company with the two other sledges we pushed on without a road, following the express sledge which ran ahead at full gallop with its ringing bells.</p>
				<p>'What! he catch them!' said my driver, referring to the man who had run to catch the horses. 'If it won’t join the other horses of itself—it’s a vicious beast—it’ll lead him a fine dance, and he won’t catch it.’</p>
				<p>From the time that he turned back, my driver seemed in better spirits and was more conversational, and as I was not sleepy I did not fail of course to take advantage of it. I began asking him where he came from, how he came here, and what he was; and soon learned that he was from my province, a Tula man, a serf from the village of Kirpitchny, that they had too little land, and that the corn had given up yielding any crop at all ever since the cholera year. There were two brothers at home, a third had gone for a soldier; they hadn’t bread enough to last till Christmas, and lived on what they could earn. His younger brother, he told me, was the head of the house because he was married, while he himself was a widower. Every year gangs of men from his village came here as drivers, though he hadn’t himself ever been a driver before; but now he had gone into the posting service so as to be a help to his brother. That he earned, thank God, one hundred and twenty roubles a year here, and sent a hundred of them home, and that it would be a pleasant life, too, ‘but the mail men were a brutal lot, very, and, indeed, all the people in these parts were a rough lot.’</p>
				<p>'Now, why did that driver abuse me? Lord, ’a’ mercy on us! Did I set the horses loose on purpose? Am I a man to do any one a mischief? And what did he gallop after them for? They’d have got home by themselves. He’s only wearing out his horses, and he’ll be lost himself too,’ repeated the God-fearing peasant.</p>
				<p>‘And what’s that blackness?’ I asked, noticing several black objects ahead of us.</p>
				<p>'Why, a train of waggons. That’s a pleasant way of travelling!’ he went on, as we overtook the huge waggons on wheels, covered with hemp sacking, following one another. ‘Look, not a man to be seen—they’re all asleep. The clever mare knows the way of herself, there’s no making her stray off the road. ... I’ve driven with a train of waggons too,’ he added, ‘so I know.’</p>
				<p>Truly it was strange to look at those huge waggons, covered with snow from their sacking top down to the wheels, moving along quite alone. But in the corner of the foremost the snow-covered sacking was lifted a little on two fingers, and a cap emerged from it for an instant when our bells were ringing close to the waggons. The big, piebald horse, stretching its neck and dragging with its back, stepped evenly along the completely buried road, and rhythmically shook its shaggy head under the whitened yoke. It pricked up one snowy ear as we came up to it.</p>
				<p>After we had driven on another half-hour, my driver addressed me again.</p>
				<p>‘Well, what do you think, sir, are we going right?'</p>
				<p>‘I don’t know,’ I answered.</p>
				<p>‘The wind was this way, sir, before, but now we’re going with our backs to the weather. No, we’re not going the right way, we’re astray again,’ he concluded with complete serenity.</p>
				<p>It was clear that though he was very timorous, even death, as they say, is pleasant in company; he had become perfectly composed since we were a large party, and he had not to be the guide and responsible person. With great coolness he made observations on the mistakes of the driver of the foremost sledge, as though he had not the slightest interest in the matter. I did notice, indeed, that the foremost sledge was sometimes visible in profile on my left, sometimes on the right; it positively seemed to me as though we were going round in a very small space. This might, however, have been an illusion of the senses, just as sometimes it looked to me as though the first sledge were driving up-hill, or along a slope, or down-hill, though the steppe was everywhere level.</p>
				<p>We had driven on a good while longer, when I discerned—far away, it seemed to me, on the very horizon—a long black moving streak. But a minute later it was evident to me that this was the same train of waggons we had overtaken before. Just as before, the snow lay on the creaking wheels, some of which did not turn at all, indeed. As before, all the men were asleep under the sacking covers, and as before, the piebald horse in front, with inflated nostrils, sniffed out the road and pricked up its ears.</p>
				<p>‘There, we've gone round and round, and we've come back to the same waggons again!’ said my driver in a tone of dissatisfaction. ‘The mail horses are good ones, and so he can drive them in this mad way; but ours will come to a dead stop if we go on like this all night.’</p>
				<p>He cleared his throat.</p>
				<p>‘Let us turn back, sir, before we come to harm.’</p>
				<p>‘What for? Why, we shall get somewhere.’</p>
				<p>‘Get somewhere! Why, we shall spend the night on the steppe. How the snow does blow! . . . Lord, ’a’ mercy on us!’</p>
				<p>Though I was surprised that the foremost driver, who had obviously lost both the road and the direction, did not attempt to look for the road, but calling merrily to his horses drove on still at full trot, I did not feel inclined now to drop behind the other sledges.</p>
				<p>‘Follow them!’ I said.</p>
				<p>My driver went on, but he drove the horses now with less eagerness than before, and he did not address another syllable to me.</p>

				<p>The storm became more and more violent, and fine frozen snow was falling from the sky. It seemed as though it were beginning to freeze; my nose and cheeks felt the cold more keenly; more often a draught of cold air crept in under my fur cloak, and I had to wrap myself up more closely. From time to time the sledge jolted over a bare, broken crust of ice where the snow had blown away. Though I was much interested in seeing how our wanderings would end, yet, as I had been travelling six hundred versts without stopping for a night, I could not help shutting my eyes and I dropped into a doze. Once when I opened my eyes, I was struck by what seemed to me for the first minute the bright light shed over the white plain. The horizon had grown noticeably wider; the black, lowering sky had suddenly vanished; on all sides one could see the white, slanting lines of falling snow; the outlines of the horses of the front sledge were more distinctly visible, and when I looked upwards it seemed to me for the first minute that the storm-clouds had parted and that only the falling snow hid the sky. While I had been dozing, the moon had risen and cast its cold, bright light through the thin clouds and falling snow. All that I could see distinctly was my own sledge with the horse and driver and the three sledges with their horses ahead of us. In the first, the mail sledge, the one driver still sat on the box driving his horses at a smart trot. In the second there were two men, who, letting go their reins and making themselves a shelter out of a cloak, were all the time smoking a pipe, as we could see from the gleaming sparks. In the third sledge no one was to be seen; the driver was presumably asleep in the middle of it. The driver in front had, when I waked, begun stopping his horses and looking for the road. Then, as soon as we stopped, the howling of the wind became more audible, and the astoundingly immense mass of snow driving in the air was more evident to me. I could see in the moonlight, veiled by the drifting snow, the short figure of the driver holding a big whip with which he was trying the snow in front of him. He moved backwards and forwards in the white darkness, came back to the sledge again, jumped sideways on the front seat, and again through the monotonous whistling of the wind we could hear his jaunty, musical calling to his horses and the ringing of the bells. Every time that the front driver got out to search for signs of the road or of stacks, a brisk self-confident voice from the second sledge shouted to him—</p>
				<p>'I say, Ignashka, we've gone right off to the left! Keep more to the right, away from the storm.’ Or, 'Why do you go round and round like a fool? Go the way of the snow, you’ll get there all right.’ Or, 'To the right, go on to the right, my lad! See, there ’s something black—a verst post may be.’ Or, 'What are you pottering about for? Unyoke the piebald and let him go first; he’ll bring you on the road in a trice. That’ll be the best plan.’</p>
				<p>The man who gave this advice did not himself unyoke the trace-horse, nor get out into the snow to look for the road; he did not so much as poke his nose out beyond the shelter of the cloak, and when Ignashka in reply to one of his counsels, shouted to him that he’d better ride on in front himself as he knew which way to go, the giver of good advice answered that, if he were driving the mail horses, he would ride on and would soon bring them on to the road. 'But our horses won’t lead the way in a storm!’ he shouted; 'they’re not that sort!’</p>
				<p>'Don’t meddle then!’ answered Ignashka, whistling merrily to his horses.</p>
				<p>The other driver, sitting in the same sledge as the counsellor, said nothing to Ignashka, and refrained altogether from taking part in the proceedings, though he was not yet asleep, as I concluded from his still glowing pipe, and from the fact that when we stopped I heard his regular, continuous talk. He was telling a tale. Only once, when Ignashka stopped for the sixth or seventh time, apparently vexed at the interruption in his enjoyment of the drive, he shouted to him—</p>
				<p>‘Why, what are you stopping again for? . . , Trying to find the road, indeed! Don’t you see, there’s a snow-storm! The land-surveyor himself couldn’t find the road now; you should drive on as long as the horses will go. We shan’t freeze to death, I don’t suppose. . . . Do go on!’</p>
				<p>'I dare say! A postillion was frozen to death last year, sure enough!’ my driver retorted.</p>
				<p>The man in the third sledge did not wake up all the time. Only once, while we were halting, the counsellor shouted—</p>
				<p>'Filip, aye . . . Filip!’ And receiving no reply, he remarked, ‘I say, he’s not frozen, is he? . . . You’d better look, Ignashka.’</p>
				<p>Ignashka, who did everything, went up to the sledge and began to poke the sleeper.</p>
				<p>'I say, one drink has done for him. If you’re frozen, just say so!’ he said, shaking him.</p>
				<p>The sleeping man muttered some words of abuse.</p>
				<p>'Alive, lads!’ said Ignashka, and he ran ahead again, and again we drove on, and so fast indeed that the little sorrel trace-horse of my sledge, who was constantly being lashed about its tail, more than once broke into a clumsy gallop.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>
				<p>It was, I think, about midnight when the old man and Vassily, who had gone in pursuit of the strayed horses, rode up to us. They had caught the horses, and found and overlook us. But how they managed to do this in the dark, blinding blizzard, across the bare steppe, has always remained a mystery to me. The old man with his elbows and legs jogging, trotted up on the shaft-horse (the other two horses were fastened to the yoke; horses cannot be left loose in a blizzard). On overtaking us, he began railing at my driver again.</p>
				<p>‘You see, you cross-eyed devil, what a . . .’</p>
				<p>'Hey, Uncle Mitritch,’ shouted the story-teller from the second sledge, 'alive are you? . . . Come in to us.’</p>
				<p>But the old man, making no answer, went on scolding. When he judged he had said enough, he rode up to the second sledge.</p>
				<p>'Caught them all?’ was asked him from the sledge.</p>
				<p>‘I should think so!’</p>
				<p>And his little figure bent forward with his breast on the horse’s back while it was at full trot; then he slipped off into the snow, and without stopping an instant ran after the sledge, and tumbled into it, pulling his legs up over the side. The tall Vassily seated himself as before, in silence, in the front sledge with Ignashka, and began looking for the road with him.</p>
				<p>'You see what an abusive fellow . . . Lord ’a’ mercy on us!’ muttered my driver.</p>
				<p>For a long while after this we drove on without a halt over the white wilderness, in the cold, luminous, and flickering twilight of the snow-storm.</p>
				<p>I open my eyes. The same clumsy cap and back, covered with snow, are standing up in front of me; the same low-arched yoke, under which, between the tight, leather reins, the head of the shaft-horse shakes up and down always at the same distance away, with its black mane blown rhythmically by the wind in one direction. Over its back on the right there is a glimpse of the bay trace-horse with its tail tied up short and the swinging bar behind it knocking now and then against the framework of the sledge. If I look down—the same crunching snow torn up by the sledge runners, and the wind persistently lifting it and carrying it off, always in the same direction. In front the foremost sledge is running on, always at the same distance; on the right and left everything is white and wavering. In vain the eye seeks some new object; not a post, not a stack, not a hedge—nothing to be seen. Everywhere all is white, white and moving. At one moment the horizon seems inconceivably remote, at the next closed in, two paces away on all sides. Suddenly a high, white wall shoots up on the right, and runs alongside the sledge, then all at once it vanishes and springs up ahead, to flee further and further away, and vanish again. One looks upwards; it seems light for the first minute—one seems to see stars shining through a mist; but the stars fly further and further away from the sight, and one can see nothing but the snow, which falls past the eyes into the face and the collar of one’s cloak. Everywhere the sky is equally light, equally white, colourless, alike and ever moving. The wind seems to shift; at one time it blows in our faces and glues our eyes up with snow, then teazingly it flings one’s fur collar on one’s head and flaps it mockingly in one’s face, then it drones behind in some chink of the sledge. One hears the faint, never-ceasing crunch of hoofs and runners over the snow, and the jingle of the bells, dying down as we drive over deep snow. Only at times when we are going against the wind and over some bare, frozen headland, Ignashka’s vigorous whistling and the melodious tinkle of the bells with the jangling fifth float clearly to one’s hearing, and these sounds make a comforting break in the desolateness of the snowy waste, and then again the bells fall back into the same monotonous jingle, with intolerable correctness ringing ever the same phrase, which I cannot help picturing to myself in musical notes.</p>
				<p>One of my legs began to get chilled, and when I turned over to wrap myself up closer, the snow on my collar and cap slipped down my neck and made me shiver; but on the whole, in my fur cloak, warmed through by the heat of my body, I still kept warm and was beginning to feel drowsy.</p>
