					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">I</h3>
					<p>Towards the end of August, between Douvánka<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-70" id="noteref-70" epub:type="noteref">70</a> and Bahtchisaráy, through the hot, thick dust of the rocky and hilly highway, an officer's trap was slowly toiling towards Sevastopol (that peculiar kind of trap you never meet anywhere else, something between a Jewish <i xml:lang="ru">brítchka</i>, a Russian cart, and a basket).</p>
					<p>In the front of the trap, pulling at the reins, squatted an orderly in a nankeen coat and wearing a cap that had once belonged to an officer but was now quite limp: behind, on bundles and bales covered with a soldier's cloak, sat an infantry officer in a summer cloak. The officer, as far as one could judge while he was sitting, was not tall, but was very broad and massive, not so much across the shoulders as from back to chest. His neck and the back of his head were much developed and very solid. He had not what we call a waist, nor was he at all stouter round the stomach: on the contrary, he was rather lean, especially in the face, which was burnt to an unwholesome yellow. He would have been good-looking had it not been for a certain puffiness, and for the broad, soft wrinkles, not due to age, which blurred the outlines of his features, making them seem larger and giving the face a general look of coarseness and lack of freshness. His small eyes were hazel, with a daring and even insolent expression: he had very thick but not broad moustaches, the ends of which were bitten off, and his chin, and especially his jaws, were covered with an exceedingly strong, thick, black, two-days-old beard.</p>
					<p>This officer had been wounded in the head by a bomb splinter on the 10th of May and still wore a bandage; but having felt well again for the last week, he had left the hospital at Simferópol and was now on his way to rejoin his regiment, stationed somewhere in the direction whence the firing came—but whether in Sevastopol itself, on the North Side, or at Inkerman, no one had yet been able to tell him for certain. Already the frequent firing, especially at times when no hills intercepted it and when the wind carried it this way, sounded exceedingly distinct and seemed quite near. Now an explosion shook the air and made one start involuntarily; now sounds less loud followed each other in quick succession like the roll of drums, broken now and then by a startling boom; now again all these sounds mingled into a kind of rolling crash, like peals of thunder when a storm is raging in all its fury and rain has just begun to fall in torrents. Every one was saying (and besides one could hear for oneself) that a terrific bombardment was going on. The officer kept telling his orderly to drive faster; he seemed in a hurry to get to his destination. They met a train of Russian peasants' carts that had taken provisions to Sevastopol and were now on their way back laden with sick and wounded soldiers in grey uniforms, sailors in black cloaks, volunteers with red fezzes on their heads, and bearded militiamen. The officer's trap had to stand still in the thick, motionless cloud of dust raised by this train of carts, and the officer, frowning and blinking while his eyes filled with dust, sat looking at the faces of the sick and wounded who were passing.</p>
					<p>“There's a soldier of our company! That one who is so weak," said the Orderly, turning to his master and pointing to a cart laden with wounded men then just passing them.</p>
					<p>A bearded Russian with a felt hat sat sideways in the front of the cart plaiting the lash of a whip, the handle of which he held to his side with his elbow. Behind him in the cart five or six soldiers, lying and sitting in different positions, were being jolted along. One, with a bandaged arm and his cloak thrown loosely over his shirt, though he looked pale and thin, sat upright in the middle of the cart and raised his hand as if to salute the officer, but remembering, probably, that he was wounded, pretended he only meant to scratch his head. A man lay beside him on the bottom of the cart, of whom all that was visible was his two hands holding on to the sides of the cart, and his lifted knees swaying this way and that like rags. A third, with a swollen face and with a soldier's cap shaking on the top of his bandaged head, sat sideways with his feet hanging out, and, leaning his elbows on his knees, seemed to be dozing. The officer addressed him: “Dolzhnikóf!” he cried.</p>
					<p>“Here!” said the soldier, opening his eyes and taking off his cap, and answering in such a loud, abrupt bass that it sounded as if twenty soldiers had shouted all together.</p>
					<p>“When were you wounded, lad?”</p>
					<p>The soldier's leaden eyes with their swollen lids brightened up; he had evidently recognised his officer.</p>
					<p>"Good-day, y'r 'onor!” said the soldier in the same abrupt bass.</p>
					<p>“Where is your regiment stationed now?”</p>
					<p>“In Sevastopol. We were going to move on Wednesday, y'r 'onor!”</p>
					<p>"Where to?”</p>
					<p>“Don't know, y'r 'onor—to the North Side, maybe.—Now they're firing right across, y'r 'onor," he added in a long-drawn tone, replacing his cap: “mostly bombs—they reach right across the bay. <em>He's</em> giving it us awful hot now..."</p>
					<p>What the soldier said further could not be heard, but the expression of his face and his bearing showed that his words, spoken with the bitterness of one suffering, were not reassuring.</p>
					<p>The officer in the trap, Lieutenant Kozeltsóf, was not an every-day sort of man. He was not one of those who live and act this way or that because others live and act so; he did what he liked, and others followed his example, and felt sure it was right. He had a nature endowed with many minor gifts: he could sing well, played the guitar, talked smartly and wrote very easily (especially official papers, the knack of writing which he had gained when he was adjutant of his battalion); but the most remarkable characteristic of his nature was his ambitious energy, which, though chiefly founded on those same minor talents, was in itself a marked and striking feature. He had ambition of a kind most often found in male circles, especially military, and this had become so much a part of his life that he could imagine no other line than to dominate or to perish. Ambition was at the root even of his inward impulses, and in his private thoughts he liked to put himself first when he compared himself with others.</p>
					<p>“It's likely I should pay attention to the chatter of a Tommy!" muttered the Lieutenant, with a feeling of heaviness and apathy at heart and a certain dimness of thought, left by the sight of the convoy of wounded men, and by the words of the soldier, enforced as they were by the sounds of the cannonade.</p>
					<p>"Funny fellow that Tommy! Now then, Nikoláyef, get on!... are you asleep?” he added rather fretfully, as he arranged the skirt of his cloak.</p>
					<p>Nikoláyef jerked the reins, clicked his tongue, and the trap rolled on at a trot.</p>
					<p>“We'll only stop just to feed the horse, and then we'll go on at once: to-day,” said the officer.</p>

					<p>At the entrance to a street of remains of ruined stone Tartar houses in Douvánka, Lieutenant Kozeltsóf was stopped by a convoy of bombs and cannon-balls on its way to Sevastopol, which blocked the road.</p>
					<p>Two foot-soldiers sat on the stones of a ruined wall in the midst of a cloud of dust eating a water-melon and bread.</p>
					<p>“Going far, comrade?" asked one of them, with his mouth full of bread, as another soldier with a little bag on his back stopped near them.</p>
					<p>“Going to join our regiment,” answered the soldier, looking past the water-melon and readjusting his bag: “We have been nigh on three weeks in the province looking after hay for our company, but now we've all been recalled, but we don't know where the regiment is. Some say it crossed to the Korábelnaya last week. Perhaps you have heard, good people?”</p>
					<p>“In the town, friend, it's quartered in the town," muttered the other, an old convoy soldier, who was digging with a clasp-knife into an unripe, whitish water-melon. “We've only come from there since noon. Ah, it's awful there, my lad!”</p>
					<p>“How so, good people?”</p>
					<p>“Why, can't you hear? They're firing from all sides to-day, there's not a place left whole. As for the likes of us as has been killed—there's no counting 'em!” And making an expressive gesture with his hand the speaker put his cap straight.</p>
					<p>The soldier who had stopped shook his head meditatively and clicked his tongue, then he took a pipe out of his boot-leg, and, without filling it, merely loosened the scorched tobacco in it, and lit a bit of tinder at the pipe of one of the soldiers. Then he raised his cap and said—</p>
					<p>“One can't get away from God, good people! Forgive me.” And straightening his bag with a jerk he went his way.</p>
					<p>“Ah, it would be far better to wait!” said with conviction he who was digging into the water-melon.</p>
					<p>“It all comes to the same!” muttered the soldier, squeezing between the wheels of the crowded carts.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
					<p>The posting-station was full of people when Kozeltsóf drove up. The first person he met in the porch was a very young, lean man, the superintendent, bickering with two officers who were following him.</p>
					<p>“It's not three days, but maybe ten you'll have to wait... even generals have to wait, sirs!” said the superintendent, wishing to hurt the travellers' feelings: “I can't harness myself for you, can I?”</p>
					<p>“Then don't give horses to anybody if you have none! Why did you give them to that lackey with the baggage?" shouted the elder of the officers, who had a tumbler of tea in his hand.</p>
					<p>“Just consider a moment, Mr. Superintendent,” said the other, a very young officer, hesitatingly: “we are not going for our own pleasure. You see we too must be needed there, since we are summoned. I shall really have to report it to the General. It will never do, you know... you, it seems, don't respect an officer's position."</p>
					<p>But the elder interrupted him crossly. “You always spoil everything! You only hamper me; one must know how to speak to these people. There now, he has lost all respect.... Horses, I say, this very minute!”</p>
					<p>“Willingly, my dear sir, but where am I to get them from?”</p>
					<p>The superintendent was silent for a few moments. Then he suddenly flared up, and waving his arms he began:—</p>
					<p>“I know it all very well, my dear sir, and fully understand it, but what's one to do? You give me but” (a ray of hope appeared on the faces of the officers)... "let me but hold out to the end of the month, and I'll remain here no longer. I'd rather go to the Maláhof Hill than remain here, I swear I would! Let them do what they please. There's not one sound vehicle in the whole place, and it's the third day the horses haven't had a wisp of hay." And the superintendent disappeared behind the gate.</p>
					<p>Kozeltsóf entered the room together with the officers.</p>
					<p>“Well," said the elder very calmly to the younger, though the moment before he had seemed quite beside himself, “we've been three months on our way already; let's wait a little longer. Where's the harm? there's time enough!"</p>
					<p>The dirty, smoky room was so full of officers and trunks that Kozeltsóf with difficulty found a seat on the window-sill. While observing the faces and listening to the conversation of the others, he began making himself a cigarette. To the right of the door, round a crooked, greasy table on which two <i xml:lang="ru">samovárs</i> stood with verdigris showing here and there, and sugar lay on various bits of paper, sat the principal group. A young moustacheless officer in a new quilted Caucasian coat was filling a teapot, and there were four other such young officers in different parts of the room. One of them with some kind of a fur coat rolled up under his head, was sleeping on the sofa; another was standing cutting up some roast mutton for a one-armed officer who was sitting at the table. Two officers, one in an Aide-de-camp's cloak, the other in infantry uniform made of fine cloth, and with a satchel across his shoulders, were sitting by the stove; and the way they looked at the others, and the manner in which the one with the satchel smoked his cigarette, proved that they were not infantry officers of the line, and were glad they were not. Their manner did not show contempt, but rather a certain calm self-satisfaction, founded partly on money and partly on intimacy with generals—a consciousness of superiority reaching even to a desire to conceal it. Then there was a thick-lipped young doctor, and an artillery officer who looked like a German—these were sitting on the sofa, almost on the feet of the sleeping officer, counting money. There were also several orderlies, some dozing, others busy with bundles and trunks near the door. Among all these people Kozeltsóf did not recognise a single acquaintance; but he listened with interest to their conversation. The young officers, who, as he at once concluded from their appearance, had come straight from a training-college, pleased him, and reminded him of the fact that his brother, who was also coming straight from the training-college, ought, in a few days' time, to reach one of the batteries in Sevastopol. But he did not like the officer with the satchel, whose face he had seen somewhere before—everything about him seemed insolent and repulsive. And thinking, “We'll put him down if he ventures to say anything,” the Lieutenant even moved from the window to the stove, and sat down there. Belonging to a line regiment and being a good officer, he, in general, did not like those “of the Staff,” and such he at once knew these officers to be.</p>

					<p>“I say, isn't it an awful nuisance that we're so near and still can't get there,” said one of the young officers. “There may be an action to-day and we shan't be in it.”</p>
					<p>The piping voice and the fresh rosy spots which appeared on his face betrayed the sweet, youthful bashfulness of one in constant fear that his words may come out wrong.</p>
					<p>The officer who had lost an arm looked at him with a smile.</p>
					<p>“You will get there quite soon enough, believe me,” he said.</p>
					<p>The young man looked with respect at the armless officer—whose emaciated face unexpectedly lit up with a smile—and became silently absorbed in making his tea. And, really, the face, the attitude, and especially the empty sleeve of the officer, expressed a kind of calm indifference, that seemed to reply to every word and action: "All this is excellent, all this I know, and all this I can do if I only wish to.”</p>
					<p>“Well, and how shall we decide it? " the young officer began again, turning to his comrade in the Caucasian coat. “Shall we stay the night here, or go on with our own horse?"</p>
					<p>His comrade decided to stay.</p>
					<p>“Just fancy, Captain,” continued he who was making the tea, addressing the one-armed officer and handing him a knife he had dropped, “we were told that horses were awfully dear in Sevastopol, so we two bought one together in Simferópol.”</p>
					<p>“I expect they made you pay a stiff price.”</p>
					<p>“I really don't know, Captain; we paid ninety roubles for it and the trap. Is that very much?” he said, turning to the company in general, including Kozeltsóf, who was looking at him.</p>
					<p>“It's not much if it's a young horse," said Kozeltsóf.</p>
					<p>“You think so?... And we were told it was too much. Only it limps a bit, but that will pass. We were told it's strong."</p>
					<p>“What training-college are you from?" asked Kozeltsóf, who wished to get news of his brother.</p>
					<p>“We are now from the Nobles' Regiment. There are six of us, and we are all going to Sevastopol—at our own desire," said the talkative young officer: "only we don't know where our battery is: some say it is in Sevastopol, but those fellows there say it is in Odessa.”</p>
					<p>“Couldn't you find out in Simferópol?" Kozeltsóf asked.</p>
					<p>"They didn't know.... Just fancy, one of our comrades went to the Chancellery there and got nothing but rudeness. Just fancy how unpleasant! Would you like a ready-made cigarette?” he said to the one-armed officer, who was trying to get out his cigar-case.</p>
					<p>He attended to this officer's wants with a kind of servile enthusiasm.</p>
					<p>"And are you also from Sevastopol?” he continued. “Oh dear, how wonderful it is! How we all in Petersburg used to think about all of you and all our heroes!” he said, addressing Kozeltsóf with respect and cordial endearment.</p>
					<p>“Well, then you may find you have to go back?” asked the Lieutenant.</p>
					<p>“That's just what we are afraid of. Just fancy, when we had bought the horse and got all that we needed—a coffee-pot with a spirit-lamp and other necessary little things—we had no money at all left," he said in a low tone, glancing at his comrade, “so that if we have to return we don't at all know how we shall manage.”</p>
					<p>“Didn't you receive your travelling allowance, then?” asked Kozeltsóf.</p>
					<p>“No," answered the young officer in a whisper; they only promised to give it us here."</p>
					<p>“Have you the certificate?”</p>
					<p>"I know that a certificate is the principal thing, but when I was at his house, a senator in Moscow—he is my uncle—told me that I should get one here; or else he would have given it me himself. But will they give me one in Sevastopol?"</p>
					<p>"Certainly they will."</p>
					<p>“And I also think shall get one there,” he said in a tone which proved that, having asked the same question at some thirty other posting-stations, and having everywhere received different answers, he no longer quite believed any one.</p>

					<p>“Who ordered soup?" demanded the rather dirty landlady, a fat woman of about forty, as she came into the room with a tureen of cabbage-soup.</p>
					<p>The conversation immediately stopped, and every one in the room fixed their eyes on the landlady. One officer even winked to another, with a glance at her.</p>
					<p>“Oh, Kozeltsóf ordered it," said the young officer. “He'll have to be woke up. ... Get up for dinner!” he said, stepping to the sofa and shaking the sleeper's shoulder. A lad of about seventeen, with merry black eyes and very rosy cheeks, jumped up energetically and stepped into the middle of the room rubbing his eyes.</p>
					<p>“Oh, I beg your pardon,” he said to the doctor, against whom he had knocked in rising.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant Kozeltsóf recognised his brother at once and went up to him.</p>
					<p>"Don't you know me?” he asked with a smile.</p>
					<p>“Ah-a-a!” cried the younger Kozeltsóf, “this is wonderful!” and he began kissing his brother.</p>
					<p>They kissed three times, but hesitated before the third kiss, as if the thought, “Why has it to be just three times?” had struck both of them.</p>
					<p>“Well, I <em>am</em> glad!” said the elder, looking into his brother's face: come out into the porch and let's have a talk."</p>
					<p>“Come, come along. I don't want any soup: you eat it, Féderson,” he said to his comrade.</p>
					<p>“But you wanted to eat.”</p>
					<p>“I don't want any."</p>
					<p>Out in the porch the younger one kept asking his brother, “Well, and how are you? Tell me how things are," and saying how glad he was to see him, but did not tell him anything about himself.</p>
					<p>After five minutes, when they had found time to be silent a little, the elder brother asked why the younger had not entered the Guards, as every one had expected.</p>
					<p>“I wanted to get to Sevastopol as soon as possible. You see, if things turn out well here, one can get on quicker than in the Guards; there it takes ten years to become a Colonel, and here in a year Todleben from a lieutenant-colonel has become a general. And if one gets killed—well, it can't be helped.”</p>
					<p>“So that's the sort of stuff you are made of!” said his brother, with a smile.</p>
					<p>“But that's nothing. The chief thing, you know, brother," said the younger, smiling and blushing as if he were going to say something very shameful—"the chief thing was that somehow one's ashamed to be living in Petersburg, while here men are dying for the Fatherland. And besides, I wished to be with you,” he added, still more shyly.</p>
					<p>The elder did not look at him. "How odd you are!” he said, and took out his cigarette-case. "Only the pity is that we shall not be together.”</p>
					<p>“I say, tell me quite frankly: is it very dreadful at the bastions?” suddenly asked the younger.</p>
					<p>“It seems dreadful at first, but one gets used to it. You'll see for yourself.”</p>
					<p>“Yes, another thing. Do you think they will take Sevastopol? I think they won't; I am certain they won't.”</p>
					<p>“Heaven only knows.”</p>
					<p>“It's so provoking.... Just think, what a misfortune: do you know, we've had a whole bundle of things stolen on the way, and my shako was inside, so that I am in a terrible position. Whatever shall I appear in?"</p>
					<p>Kozeltsóf <i xml:lang="la">secundus</i>, Vladimir, was very like his brother Michael, but it was the likeness of an opening rose-bud to a withered dog-rose. He had the same fair hair as his brother, but it was thick, and curled about his temples, and a little tail of it grew down the delicate white nape of his neck—a sign of luck according to the nurses. The delicate white skin of his face was not always flushed, but the full young blood, rushing to it, betrayed every movement of the soul. He had the same eyes as his brother, but more open and brighter, which was especially noticeable because a slight moisture often made them glisten. Soft, fair down was beginning to appear on his cheeks and above the red lips, on which a shy smile often played, disclosing the white, glistening teeth. Straight, broad-shouldered, the uniform over his red Russian shirt unbuttoned—as he stood there in front of his brother, cigarette in hand, leaning against the banisters of the porch, his face and attitude expressing naïve joy, he was such a pleasantly pretty boy that one could not help wishing to look and look at him. He was very pleased to see his brother, and looked at him with respect and pride, imagining him to be a hero; but in some respects, namely, in what in society is considered good form—being able to speak good French, knowing how to behave in the presence of people of high position, dancing, etc., he was rather ashamed of his brother, looked down on him, and even hoped, if possible, to educate him. All his impressions, so far, were from Petersburg, especially from the house of a lady who liked nice-looking lads, with whom he used to spend his holidays, and from the house of a senator in Moscow, where he had once danced at a grand ball.</p>

					<p>Having talked almost their fill, and reached a feeling which often comes when two people find there is little in common between them though they are fond of each other, the brothers remained silent for some time.</p>
					<p>"Well, then, collect your things and let us be off," said the elder.</p>
					<p>The younger suddenly blushed and became confused.</p>
					<p>“Do we go straight to Sevastopol?” he asked, after a moment's silence.</p>
					<p>“Well, of course. You have not got much luggage, I suppose; we'll get it all in.”</p>
					<p>“All right! let's start at once,” said the younger with a sigh, and went towards the room.</p>
					<p>But he stopped in the passage without opening the door, hung down his head sorrowfully and began thinking.</p>
					<p>“Now, at once, straight to Sevastopol within reach of the bombs... terrible! Ah well, never mind; it had to be sooner or later. And now, at least, it's with my brother..."</p>
					<p>The thing was, that only now, at the thought that once seated in the trap he would reach Sevastopol before again alighting, and that there were no more chances of anything detaining him, did he clearly realise the danger he had been seeking; and the thought of its nearness staggered him. Having calmed himself as well as he could, he entered the room; but a quarter of an hour passed and he did not return to his brother, SO the latter at last opened the door to call him. The younger Kozeltsóf, standing like a guilty schoolboy, was speaking with an officer. When his brother opened the door he seemed quite disconcerted.</p>
					<p>"Yes, yes, I'm just coming,” he cried, waving his hand to prevent his brother coming in. "Please wait for me there."</p>
					<p>A few minutes later he came out and approached his brother with a deep sigh. “Just fancy,” he said; “it turns out that I can't go with you, brother.”</p>
					<p>"What? what nonsense!”</p>
					<p>“I'll tell you the whole truth, Mísha... None of us have any money left, and we are all in debt to that Lieutenant-Captain whom you saw in there. It's such a shame!”</p>
					<p>The elder brother frowned, and remained silent for a considerable time.</p>
					<p>“Do you owe much?” he asked at last, looking at his brother from under his brows.</p>
					<p>"Much? No, not very much; but I feel terribly ashamed. He paid for me at three post-stations, and the sugar was always his, so that I don't... Yes, and we played at <i xml:lang="fr">preférénce</i>... and I lost a little to him.”</p>
					<p>“That's bad, Volódya! Now what would you have done if you had not met me?" the elder remarked sternly, without looking at him.</p>
					<p>“Well, you see, brother, I thought I'd pay when I got my travelling allowance in Sevastopol. I could do that, couldn't I?... So I'd better drive on with him to-morrow.”</p>
					<p>The elder brother drew out his purse and with slightly trembling fingers produced two ten-rouble notes and one of three roubles.</p>
					<p>“There's the money I have,” he said; “how much do you owe?"</p>
					<p>Kozeltsóf did not speak quite truly when he made it appear as if this were all the money he had. He had four gold coins sewn into the cuff of his sleeve in case of special need, but he had resolved not to touch them.</p>
					<p>It turned out that Kozeltsóf <i xml:lang="la">secundus</i> only owed eight roubles, including the sugar and the <i xml:lang="fr">preférénce</i>. The elder brother gave them to him, only remarking that it would never do to go playing <i xml:lang="fr">preférénce</i> when one has no money.</p>
					<p>“How high did you play?”</p>
					<p>The younger did not reply. The question seemed to suggest a doubt of his honour.... Vexed with himself, ashamed of having done something that could give rise to such suspicions, and hurt at such offensive words from the brother he so loved, his impressionable nature suffered so keenly that he did not answer. Feeling that he could not suppress the sobs which were gathering in his throat, he took the money without looking at it and returned to his comrades.</p>

					<p>Nikoláyef, who had strengthened himself in Douvánka with two cups of <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-71" id="noteref-71" epub:type="noteref">71</a> sold by a soldier he had met on the bridge, kept pulling at the reins, and the trap jumped along the stony, and here and there shady, road that leads by the Belbéc to Sevastopol. The two brothers, with their legs touching as they jolted along, sat in obstinate silence, though they never ceased to think about each other.</p>
					<p>“Why did he offend me?” thought the younger. “Could he not have left that unsaid? Just as if he thought me a thief: and I think he is still angry, so that we have gone apart for good. And how fine it would have been for us to be together in Sevastopol! Two brothers, friends with one another, fighting the enemy side by side: one, the elder, not highly educated but a brave warrior, and the other, young, but... also a fine fellow... In a week's time I would have proved to everybody that I am not so very young! I shall leave off blushing, and my face will look manly; my moustaches, too, will have grown by that time—not very big, but quite sufficient,” and he pulled at the short down that showed at the corners of his mouth. “Perhaps when we get there to-day we may go straight into action, he and I together. And I'm certain he must be steadfast and very brave; a man who says little but does more than others. I wonder whether or not he is pushing me to the very edge of the trap on purpose. He surely feels that I am uncomfortable, and pretends not to notice me." He continued his meditation, pressing to the edge of the seat, and afraid to stir lest his brother should notice that he was uncomfortable: “So we'll get there to-day, and then, maybe, straight to the bastion; I with the guns, and brother with his company, both together. Then supposing the French come down on us, I shall fire and fire. I kill quite a lot of them, but they still keep coming straight at me. I can no longer fire, and of course there is no escape for me; but suddenly my brother rushes to the front with his sword drawn, and I seize a musket and we run on with the soldiers. The French attack my brother: I run forward, kill one Frenchman, then another, and save my brother. I am wounded in one arm; I seize the gun in the other hand and still run on. Then my brother falls at my side, shot dead by a bullet. I stop for a moment, bend sadly over him, draw myself up and cry, 'Follow me; we will avenge him! I loved my brother more than anything on earth,' I shall say, 'I have lost him. Let us avenge him; let us annihilate the foe or let us all die here! ' They will all rush shouting after me. Then all the French army, with Pélissier himself, will advance. We shall slaughter them, but at last I shall be wounded a second and a third time, and shall fall down dying. Then all will rush to me and Gortchakóf himself will come and ask if I want anything. I shall say that I want nothing—only to be laid near my brother: that I wish to die beside him. They will carry me and lay me down by the blood-stained corpse of my brother. I shall raise myself and say only, 'Yes, you did not know how to value two men who really loved the Fatherland: now they have both fallen. May God forgive you!' and then I'll die.”</p>
					<p>Who knows how much of these dreams will come true?</p>
					<p>“I say, have you ever been in a hand-to-hand fight?” he suddenly asked, having quite forgotten he was not going to speak to his brother.</p>
					<p>“No, never,” answered the elder. “We lost two thousand from the regiment, but it was all at the fortifications, and I also was wounded there. War is not carried on at all in the way you imagine, Volódya.”</p>
					<p>The pet name Volódya touched the younger brother. He longed to put matters right with the elder, who had no idea that he had given offence.</p>
					<p>“You are not angry with me, Mísha?” he asked after a minute's pause.</p>
					<p>“Angry? What for?"</p>
					<p>“Oh, nothing... only because of what passed... it's nothing."</p>
					<p>“Not at all," answered the elder, turning towards him and slapping him on the knee.</p>
					<p>“Then forgive me if I have pained you, Mísha.” And the younger brother turned away to hide the tears that suddenly filled his eyes.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VIII</h3>
					<p>“Can this be Sevastopol already?" asked the younger brother when they reached the top of the hill.</p>
					<p>Spread out before them they saw the Roadstead with the masts of the ships, the sea with the enemy's fleet in the distance, the white shore batteries, the barracks, the aqueducts, the docks, and the buildings of the town, the white and purple clouds of smoke that, rising constantly from the yellow hills surrounding the town, floated in the blue sky, lit up by the rosy rays of the sun, which was reflected brilliantly in the sea, towards whose dark horizon it was already sinking.</p>
					<p>Volódya looked without the slightest trepidation at the dreadful place that had so long been in his mind: he even gazed with concentrated attention at this really splendid and unique sight, feeling æsthetic pleasure and an heroic sense of satisfaction at the thought that in another half-hour he would be there; and he continued gazing until, on the North Side, they came to the commissariat of his brother's regiment, where they had to ascertain the exact position of the regiment and of the battery.</p>
					<p>The officer in charge of the commissariat lived near the so-called 'new town' (a number of wooden sheds constructed by the sailors' families) in a tent connected with a good-sized shed constructed of green oak branches that had not yet had time to dry completely.</p>
					<p>The brothers found the officer seated at a dirty table on which stood a tumbler of cold tea, a tray with a <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i> bottle, and bits of dry caviare and bread. He sat in a dirty yellowish shirt, counting, with the aid of a big abacus, an enormous pile of bank-notes. But before speaking of the personality of this officer and his conversation, we must examine the interior of the shed more attentively, and see something of his way of living and his occupations. His new-built shed was as big, as strongly wattled, and as conveniently arranged with tables and seats made of turf, as though it were built for a general or the commander of a regiment. To keep the dry leaves from falling in, the top and sides were lined with three carpets, which, though hideous, were new, and must have cost money. On the iron bedstead which stood beneath the most striking carpet (depicting a lady on horseback), lay a bright red velvet-pile bedcover, a torn and dirty pillow, and a racoon fur-lined overcoat. On the table were a looking-glass in a silver frame, an exceedingly dirty silver-backed hair-brush, a broken horn comb full of greasy hair, a silver candlestick, a bottle of liqueur with an enormous red and gold label, a gold watch with a portrait of Peter I, two gold pens, a box of some kind of capsules, a crust of bread, and a scattered pack of old cards. Bottles, full and empty, were stowed away under the bed. This officer was in charge of the regimental commissariat and of the forage for the horses. With him lived his great friend, the commissioner employed on contracts. When the brothers entered, the latter was asleep in the tent, while the commissary officer was making up the regimental accounts for the month. The officer had a very handsome and military appearance: tall, with large moustaches and a portly figure. What was unpleasant about him was only a certain moistness and a puffiness about his face that almost hid his small grey eyes (as if he were filled with porter), and his extreme lack of cleanliness, from his thin greasy hair to his big bare feet slipped into some kind of ermine-lined slippers.</p>
					<p>“What a heap of money!” said Kozeltsóf <i xml:lang="la">primus</i> on entering the shed, as he fixed his eyes eagerly on the pile of bank-notes. "Ah, if you'd lend me but half, Vasíly Miháylovitch!”</p>
					<p>The commissary officer shrank back a little, recognised his visitor, and, gathering up the money, bowed without rising.</p>
					<p>"Oh, if it were mine! It's Government money, my dear fellow.... And who is that with you?” he said, putting the money into a cash-box that stood near him, and looking at Volódya.</p>
					<p>“It's my brother, straight from the training-college. We've come to learn from you where our regiment is stationed.”</p>
					<p>“Take a seat, gentlemen. Won't you have something to drink? A glass of porter, perhaps?” he said, and without taking any further notice of his visitors he rose and went out into the tent.</p>
					<p>“I don't mind if I do, Vasíly Miháylovitch.”</p>
					<p>Volódya was struck by the grandeur of the commissary officer, his off-hand manner, and the respect with which his brother addressed him.</p>
					<p>"I expect this is one of their best officers, whom they all respect—probably simple-minded, but hospitable and brave," he thought as he sat down modestly and shyly on the sofa.</p>
					<p>“Then where is our regiment stationed?" shouted the elder brother across to the tent.</p>
					<p>"What?”</p>
					<p>The question was repeated.</p>
					<p>“Seifert was here this morning: he says the regiment has gone over to the Fifth Bastion.”</p>
					<p>“Is that certain?”</p>
					<p>“If I say so, of course it's certain. However, the devil only knows if he told the truth! He'd not take much to tell a lie either. Well, will you have some porter?" said the commissary officer, still speaking from the tent.</p>
					<p>“Well, yes, I think I will," said Kozeltsóf.</p>
					<p>“And you, Ósip Ignátyevitch, will you have some?” continued the voice from the tent, apparently addressing the sleeping contractor. “Wake up; it's past four.”</p>
					<p>"Why do you bother one? I'm not asleep,” answered a thin voice lazily.</p>
					<p>“Well, get up, it's dull without you," and the commissary officer came out to his visitors.</p>
					<p>“A bottle of Simferópol porter!” he cried.</p>
					<p>The orderly entered the shed with an expression of pride as it seemed to Volódya, and in getting the porter from under the seat he jostled Volódya.</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>The bottle of porter had been emptied, and the conversation had continued for some time in the same strain, when the flap of the tent opened, and out stepped a rather short, fresh-looking man in a blue dressing-gown with tassels, and a cap with a red band and a cockade. He came twisting his little black moustaches and looking somewhere in the direction of one of the carpets, and answered the greetings of the officers with a scarcely perceptible movement of his shoulders.</p>
					<p>“I think I'll also have a glass,” he said, sitting down to the table.</p>
					<p>“Is it from Petersburg you've come, young man?” he remarked, addressing Volódya in a friendly manner.</p>
					<p>“Yes, sir, and I'm going to Sevastopol."</p>
					<p>“At your own request?”</p>
					<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
					<p>“Now, what do you do it for, gentlemen? I don't understand it,” remarked the commissioner. “I'd be ready to walk to Petersburg on foot, I think, if they'd let me go. My word, I'm sick of this damned life!”</p>
					<p>“What have you to complain of?” asked the elder Kozeltsóf, "as if you were not well enough off here."</p>
					<p>The contractor gave him a look and turned away.</p>
					<p>"The danger, privations, lack of everything," continued he, addressing Volódya. “And what induces you to do it? I do not at all understand you, gentlemen. If you got any profit out of it; but no. Now would it be nice, at your age, to be crippled for life?"</p>
					<p>“Some want to make a profit and others serve for honour's sake," said the elder Kozeltsóf crossly, again intervening in the conversation.</p>
					<p>“Where's the honour of it if you have nothing to eat?” said the contractor, laughing disdainfully and addressing the commissary officer, who also laughed. “Wind up and let's have the tune from <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">Lucia</i>,” he said, pointing to the music-box; “I like it."</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>“What sort of a fellow is that Vasily Miháylovitch?” asked Volódya when, in the dusk of the evening, he and his brother had left the shed and were driving to Sevastopol.</p>
					<p>“So-so, only terribly stingy. But that contractor, I can't bear to look at.... I'll give him a thrashing some day."</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IX</h3>
					<p>It was almost night when they reached Sevastopol. Driving towards the large bridge across the Roadstead Volódya was not exactly dispirited, but his heart felt heavy. All he had seen and heard was so different from his past, still recent, experiences—the large, light, parquet-floored examination hall, the jolly, friendly voices and laughter of his comrades, the new uniform, the beloved Tsar whom he had been accustomed to see for the last seven years, and who at parting from them had, with tears in his eyes, called them his children—and all he saw now was so little like his beautiful, radiant, high-souled dreams.</p>
					<p>"Well, here we are,” said the elder brother when they reached the Michael Battery and dismounted from their trap. “If they let us cross the bridge we will go at once to the Nicholas Barracks. You can stay there till the morning, and I'll go to the regiment and find out where your battery is and come for you to-morrow."</p>
					<p>“Oh, why? Let's go together," said Volódya. “I'll go to the bastion with you. It doesn't matter; one must get used to it sooner or later. If you go, so can I.”</p>
					<p>"Better not.”</p>
					<p>“No, please. I shall at least find out how..."</p>
					<p>"My advice is, don't go; but however..."</p>
					<p>The sky was clear and dark; the stars, the ever-moving fire of the bombs and the flash of the guns, already showed up brightly in the darkness. The large white building of the battery, and the beginning of the bridge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-72" id="noteref-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a>, loomed out in the darkness. Literally every second, several artillery shots and explosions ever more loudly and distinctly shook the air in quick succession. Through this roar, and as if answering it, came the dull murmur of the Roadstead. A slight breeze blew in from the sea and the air smelled moist. The brothers reached the bridge. A recruit, awkwardly striking his gun against his hand, called out, “Who goes there?"</p>
					<p>“Soldier!”</p>
					<p>“No one's allowed to pass!”</p>
					<p>"How is that? We must.”</p>
					<p>"Ask the officer.”</p>
					<p>The officer, who was sitting on an anchor dozing, rose and ordered that they should be allowed to pass.</p>
					<p>“One may go there, but not back.”</p>
					<p>“Where are you driving, all of a heap!” he shouted to the regimental waggons, which, laden high with gabions, were crowding the entrance.</p>
					<p>As the brothers were descending to the first pontoon, they came upon some soldiers going in the opposite direction and talking loudly.</p>
					<p>“If he's had his outfit money his account is squared—that's so.”</p>
					<p>“Eh, lads,” said another, “when one gets to the North Side one sees light again. My word! it's different air altogether."</p>
					<p>“Get along,” said the first. "Why, the other day a damned shot came flying here and tore off two soldiers' legs for them, so that..."</p>
					<p>Waiting for the trap, the brothers, after crossing the first pontoon, stopped on the second, on to which the waves washed here and there. The wind, which seemed gentle on land, was strong and gusty here; the bridge swayed, and the waves broke noisily against beams, anchors, and ropes, and washed over the boards. To the right, the sea, divided by a smooth, endless black line from the starry, light, bluish-grey horizon, roared dark, misty, and hostile. Far off in the distance gleamed the lights of the enemy's fleet. To the left loomed the black bulk of one of our ships, against the sides of which the waves beat audibly. A steamer, too, was visible, moving quickly and noisily from the North Side. The flash of a bomb exploding near the steamer lit up, for a moment, the gabions piled high on its deck, two men standing on the paddle-box, and the white foam and splash of the greenish waves cut by the vessel. On the edge of the bridge, his feet dangling in the water, sat a man in his shirt repairing the pontoon. In front, above Sevastopol, the same fires were flying, and louder and louder came the terrible sounds. A wave flowing in from the sea washed over the right side of the bridge and wetted Volódya's boots, and two soldiers passed by him splashing their feet through the water. Suddenly something came crashing down which lit up the bridge ahead of them, a cart driving over it, and a horseman; and bomb fragments fell whistling and splashing into the water.</p>
					<p>“Ah, Michael Semyónitch<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-73" id="noteref-73" epub:type="noteref">73</a>!” said the rider, stopping his horse in front of the elder Kozeltsóf, “have you recovered?”</p>
					<p>“As you see. And where is fate taking you?”</p>
					<p>“To the North Side for cartridges. You see, I'm taking the place of the regimental adjutant to-day.... We are expecting an attack from hour to hour.”</p>
					<p>"And where is Mártsof?”</p>
					<p>“His leg was torn off yesterday while he was sleeping in his room in town.... Did you know him?"</p>
					<p>“Is it true the regiment is now at the Fifth Bastion?”</p>
					<p>“Yes; we have taken the place of the M⁠⸺ regiment. You'd better call at the Ambulance; you'll find some of our fellows are there; they'll show you the way."</p>
					<p>“Well, and my lodgings in the Morskáya Street, are they safe?”</p>
					<p>"Eh, my dear fellow! they've long since been shattered by the bombs. You'll not know Sevastopol again; not a woman left, not a restaurant, no music: the last brothel left yesterday. It's melancholy enough now. Good-bye!”</p>
					<p>And the officer trotted away.</p>
					<p>Terrible fear suddenly overcame Volódya; he felt as if a ball or a bomb-splinter would come at once and hit him straight on the head. The damp darkness, all these sounds, especially the murmur of the splashing water—all seemed to tell him to go no farther, that no good awaited him here, that he would never again set foot on this side of the bay, that he should turn back at once and run somewhere, as far as possible from this dreadful place of death. "But perhaps it is too late, it is already now decided,” thought he, shuddering partly at the idea and partly because the water had soaked through his boots and was wetting his feet.</p>
					<p>Volódya sighed deeply and moved a few steps from his brother.</p>
					<p>“O Lord! shall I really be killed—just I? Lord, have mercy on me!” he whispered, and made the sign of the cross.</p>
					<p>"Well, Volódya, come!” said the elder brother when the trap had driven on to the bridge. “Did you see the bomb?”</p>
					<p>On the bridge the brothers met carts loaded with wounded men, with gabions, and one with furniture driven by a woman. No one stopped them at the further side.</p>
					<p>Keeping instinctively under the wall of the Nicholas Battery, and listening to the bombs that were here bursting overhead and to the howling of the falling fragments, the brothers came silently to that part of the battery where the icón hangs. Here they heard that the Fifth Light Artillery, to which Volódya was appointed, was stationed at the Korábelnaya,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-74" id="noteref-74" epub:type="noteref">74</a> and they decided that Volódya, in spite of the danger, should spend the night with his elder brother at the Fifth Bastion, and go from there to his battery next morning. After turning into a corridor and stepping across the legs of the soldiers who lay sleeping all along the wall of the battery, they at last reached the Ambulance Station.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">X</h3>
					<p>Entering the first room, lined with beds on which wounded men were lying, and the air of which was permeated with a horribly disgusting hospital smell, they met two Sisters of Mercy just going out.</p>
					<p>One, a woman of fifty, with black eyes and a stern expression, was carrying bandages and lint and giving orders to a young lad, a medical assistant, who was following her. The other, a very pretty girl of about twenty, whose pale, tender, fair face looked with a peculiarly sweet helplessness from under her white cap, was walking with her hands in her apron pockets by the side of the elder woman, and seemed afraid of being left behind.</p>
					<p>Kozeltsóf asked them if they knew where Mártsof was, whose leg had been torn off the day before.</p>
					<p>“He is of the P⁠⸺ regiment, I think?" asked the elder. "Is he a relation of yours?”</p>
					<p>“No, a comrade."</p>
					<p>“Take them to him," said she in French to the young Sister. “It is this way,” and she herself, followed by the assistant, went to one of the patients.</p>
					<p>“Come along; what are you looking at?” said Kozeltsóf to Volódya, who stood with raised brows and a look of suffering on his face, unable to tear his eyes from the wounded. “Come now!”</p>
					<p>Volódya followed his brother, but still kept looking back and repeating unconsciously, “O my God! my God!”</p>
					<p>“I suppose he has not been here long?” the Sister remarked to Kozeltsóf, with reference to Volódya, who followed them along the corridor with exclamations and sighs.</p>
					<p>“He has only just come.”</p>
					<p>The pretty Sister looked at Volódya, and suddenly began to cry.</p>
					<p>“My God! my God! when will it end?” she said, with despair in her voice.</p>
					<p>They entered the officers' ward. Mártsof was lying on his back, his sinewy arms, bare to the elbow, thrown behind his head, and an expression on his yellow face as of a man who has clenched his teeth to keep himself from screaming with pain. His sound leg with a stocking on showed from under the blanket, and one could see the toes moving spasmodically.</p>
					<p>“Well, how are you?” asked the Sister, raising his slightly bald head with her slender delicate fingers (on one of which Volódya noticed a gold ring) and arranging his pillow.</p>
					<p>“In pain, of course!” he answered angrily. “That'll do—the pillow's all right!” and the toes in the stocking moved still faster. "How d’you do? What's your name?”—“Excuse me,” he said, when Kozeltsóf had told him. “Ah yes, I beg pardon! one forgets everything here. Why, we lived together," he added, without any sign of pleasure, and looked inquiringly at Volódya.</p>
					<p>“This is my brother, arrived to-day from Petersburg.”</p>
					<p>“H'm! And I have got my discharge," said the wounded man, frowning. “Oh, how it hurts; if only it would be over quicker."</p>
					<p>He drew up his leg and, moving his toes still more rapidly, covered his face with his hands.</p>
					<p>“He must be left alone," said the Sister in a whisper, while tears filled her eyes: “he is very ill.”</p>
					<p>While yet on the North Side the brothers had decided to go to the Fifth Bastion together, but on leaving the Nicholas Battery it was as though they had agreed not to expose themselves to needless danger, and, without mentioning the matter, they decided to go each his own way.</p>
					<p>“Only, how will you find it, Volódya?" said the elder. “Look here! Nikoláyef shall take you to the Korábelnaya, and I'll go on alone and come to you to-morrow.”</p>
					<p>Nothing more was said at this last parting between the brothers.</p>
				</section>
				<section id="sevastopol-in-august-1855-11" epub:type="chapter">
					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XI</h3>
					<p>The thunder of the cannonade continued with unabated violence. Ekateríninskaya Street, down which Volódya walked followed by the silent Nikoláyef, was quiet and deserted. In the dark he could distinguish only the broad street with white walls of large houses many of which were in ruins, and the stone pavement along which he was walking. Now and then he met some soldiers and officers. As he was passing by the left side of the Admiralty Building a bright light inside showed him the acacias planted along the sidewalk of the streets, with green stakes to support them, and sickly, dusty leaves. He distinctly heard his own footsteps and those of Nikoláyef, who followed him breathing heavily. He was not thinking of anything: the pretty Sister of Mercy, Mártsof's foot with the toes moving in the stocking, the darkness, the bombs, and different images of death, floated dimly before his imagination. The whole of his young, impressionable soul was weighed down and crushed by a sense of loneliness, and of the general indifference shown to his fate in these dangerous surroundings. “I shall be killed; I shall suffer, endure torments, and no one will shed a tear!” And all this in place of the hero's life, full of energy and evoking sympathy, that had figured in his beautiful dreams. The bombs burst and whistled nearer and nearer. Nikoláyef sighed more and more often but did not speak. As they were crossing the bridge that led to the Korábelnaya he saw a whistling something fall and disappear into the water near by, lighting for a second the lilac waves to a flaming red, and then come splashing up again.</p>
					<p>“Look there! it was not extinguished,” said Nikoláyef in a hoarse voice.</p>
					<p>“Yes,” answered Volódya, in an involuntarily high-pitched, plaintive tone which surprised him.</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>They met wounded men carried on stretchers, and more carts loaded with gabions; on the Korábelnaya they met a regiment, and men on horseback rode past. One of these was an officer followed by a Cossack. He was riding at a trot; but seeing Volódya he stopped his horse near him, looked in his face, turned away, and, touching his horse with the whip, rode on.</p>
					<p>“Alone, alone! no one cares whether I exist or not,” thought the lad, and felt inclined to cry in real earnest.</p>
					<p>At the top of the hill, past a high wall, he entered a street of small shattered houses continually lit up by the bombs. A dishevelled, tipsy woman, coming out of a gate with a sailor, knocked up against Volódya.</p>
					<p>“Then if he'sh a man o' 'onor,” she muttered—“pardon y'r exshensh offisher!”</p>
					<p>The poor lad's heart ached more and more. On the dark horizon the lightnings flashed more and more frequently, and the bombs whistled and exploded more and more often around them. Nikoláyef sighed, and suddenly began to speak in an awe-restrained tone, as it seemed to Volódya.</p>
					<p>“There now, and we were in such a hurry to get here! Always push on and push on! This is a fine place to hurry to!”</p>
					<p>“Well, but if my brother had recovered his health," answered Volódya, hoping by conversation to disperse the dreadful feeling that had seized him.</p>
					<p>“Health indeed! Where's his health when he's quite ill? Even them as is really well had best lie in hospital these times. Not much pleasure to be got. All you get is to have a leg or arm carried off! It's done before you know where you are! Here, even in the town, what horrors! but what's it like at the <em>baksions</em>! One says all the prayers one knows going there. See the beastly thing how it twangs past you!” he added, listening to the buzzing of a flying fragment.</p>
					<p>“Now,” continued Nikoláyef, “I'm to show y'r honor the way. Our business is in course to obey orders: what's ordered has to be done; but the trap's been left with some Tommie or other, and the bundle's untied.... 'Go! go!' but if something's lost, why Nikoláyef answers for it!”</p>
					<p>After a few steps more, they came to the square. Nikoláyef was silent, but kept sighing.</p>
					<p>Then he said suddenly, “There, y'r honor, there's where your <em>antillary's</em> stationed. Ask the sentinel, he'll show you."</p>
					<p>Again a few steps, and Volódya no longer heard Nikoláyef sighing behind him. Then he suddenly felt himself quite, utterly, alone. This sense of loneliness, face to face, as it seemed to him, with death, pressed like a heavy, cold stone on his heart. He stopped in the midst of the square, glanced round to see if any one were looking, grasped his head and thought with horror—</p>
					<p>“O Lord! am I really a vile, miserable coward... when it's for my Fatherland, for the Tsar, for whom I used to long to die? No! I am a miserable, wretched being!” And Volódya, filled with despair and disappointed with himself, asked the sentinel the way to the house of the Commander of the battery and went where he was directed.</p>
