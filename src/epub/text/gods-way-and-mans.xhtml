				<p>It happened in Russia in the 'seventies, when the struggle between the Revolutionists and the Government was at its height.</p>
				<p>The General-Governor of a district in South Russia, a healthy-looking German with drooping moustaches and a cold look on his expressionless face, dressed in a military uniform, with a white cross at his neck, sat one evening in his cabinet, at a table on which were placed four candles with green shades, looking through and signing papers left for him by his secretary.</p>
				<p>Among those papers was the death-warrant of Anatole Svetlogoúb, a graduate of the Novorossíysk University, sentenced for taking part in a conspiracy to overthrow the then existing Government. The General, frowning deeply, signed that paper, too. With his white, well-kept fingers, wrinkled by old age and the use of much soap, he carefully adjusted the edges of the sheets and laid them aside. The next paper dealt with the sums assigned for the carriage of provender. He read this attentively, considering whether the amounts were correctly or wrongly calculated, when suddenly he remembered a talk he had had with his assistant about Svetlogoúb's case. The General thought that the dynamite found in Svetlogoúb's possession was not sufficient proof of criminal intentions; while the assistant insisted that besides the dynamite there was sufficient evidence to prove that Svetlogoúb was the leader of the gang. And, remembering this, the General became thoughtful; and his heart, under the padded coat with facings as stiff as cardboard, began to beat nervously; and he breathed so hard that the large white cross—the object of his joy and pride—visibly rose and sank on his breast. The secretary might still be called back, and the sentence might at least be delayed, if not remitted.</p>
				<p>"Shall I call him back, or shall I not?"</p>
				<p>His heart beat more irregularly. He rang; and the courier entered with quick, nervous footsteps.</p>
				<p>"Has Iván Matvéitch gone?"</p>
				<p>"No, your Excellency; he is in the office."</p>
				<p>The General's heart now stopped, now beat quickly. He remembered the warnings of the doctor who had examined him a few days before.</p>
				<p>"Above all," the doctor had said, "if you begin to feel that you have a heart, stop working—divert your mind. There is nothing so bad as agitation. On no account allow yourself to be agitated."</p>
				<p>"Shall I call him, your Excellency?"</p>
				<p>"No, it is not necessary," answered the General. "Yes," said he to himself, "nothing is so agitating as indecision. It is signed and done with.... '<i xml:lang="de">Ein jeder macht sich sein Bett und muss d'rauf schlafen</i>'"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-320" id="noteref-320" epub:type="noteref">320</a>: he repeated his favourite proverb. "Besides, it is not my business. I only fulfil the Supreme Will,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-321" id="noteref-321" epub:type="noteref">321</a> and must stand above that kind of consideration," he added, frowning to awaken in himself the cruelty which was not natural to him.</p>
				<p>And here he remembered his last interview with the Tsar—how the latter had fixed his cold, icy look on him and had said: "I trust you! As in war you did not spare yourself, so you must act with the same firmness now in the fight with the 'red ones,' and must not allow yourself to be either deceived or frightened.... Good-bye!" Then the Tsar had embraced him, offering his shoulder to the General to kiss. The General recalled the words with which he had answered the Tsar: "My one desire is to give my life to serve my Emperor and my country!"</p>
				<p>And as he recalled the feeling of servile emotion which the consciousness of his self-sacrificing loyalty to his Sovereign had evoked in him, he drove from his mind the thought which for a moment had disturbed him—signed the rest of the papers, and rang again.</p>
				<p>"Is tea ready?" he asked.</p>
				<p>"It is just being served, your Excellency."</p>
				<p>"All right... you may go."</p>
				<p>The Governor sighed deeply, and rubbed the place where his heart was. Then, heavily treading through the large empty hall, with its freshly polished parquet-floor, he went towards the drawing-room, whence came the sound of voices.</p>
				<p>The General's wife had visitors: the Governor and his wife; an old Princess, an ardent patriot; and an officer of the Guards—the fiancé of his last unmarried daughter. His wife, a thin-lipped, cold-faced woman, sat at a low table, on which tea was laid, a silver teapot standing on the top of the samovár. She was speaking with affected sadness of her anxiety about her husband's health, to the Governor's wife—a lady who gave herself the airs of a young woman.</p>
				<p>"Every day fresh information brings to light conspiracies and all sorts of dreadful things.... And it all falls on Basil—he has to decide everything."</p>
				<p>"Oh, don't mention it!" said the Princess. "<i xml:lang="fr">Je deviens féroce quand je pense à cette maudite engeance!</i>"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-322" id="noteref-322" epub:type="noteref">322</a></p>
				<p>"Yes, yes... it's awful! Will you believe it? He works twelve hours a day, and with his weak heart, too. I really am afraid...."</p>
				<p>Seeing her husband enter, she did not finish the sentence.</p>
				<p>"Oh yes, you must hear him! Barbini is a wonderful tenor," she said, smiling amiably at the Governor's wife. She referred to a singer newly arrived in Russia, and did so as naturally as though he had been the sole subject of their conversation.</p>
				<p>The General's daughter, a plump, pretty young girl, was sitting with her fiancé behind a Chinese screen at the other end of the drawing-room. They both rose and went up to her father.</p>
				<p>"Dear me! Why, we have not yet seen one another to-day!" said the General, kissing his daughter and pressing her fiancé's hand.</p>
				<p>After greeting his guests, the General sat down at a small table, and began talking with the Governor about the latest news.</p>
				<p>"No, no! You must not talk business—it is forbidden!" the General's wife said, interrupting the Governor. "Ah... and, as luck will have it, here is Kópyef: he will tell us something amusing!"</p>
				<p>And Kópyef, noted for his gaiety and wit, did tell them the latest anecdote, which made everybody laugh.</p>

				<p>"No, no! It cannot be, it cannot!... Let me go!" Svetlogoúb's mother shouted piercingly, struggling to free herself from the grasp of the schoolmaster—her son's friend—and of the doctor, who were trying to keep her back.</p>
				<p>Svetlogoúb's mother was a nice-looking middle-aged woman, with grey curls and a star of wrinkles near each eye.</p>
				<p>The schoolmaster, when he heard that the death-warrant was signed, wanted to prepare her gently for the terrible news; but he had hardly begun to speak about her son when, by the tone of his voice and his timid look, she guessed that what she dreaded had really happened. This took place in a small room in the best hotel in the town.</p>
				<p>"Oh dear! Why do you hold me? Let go!" she shouted, freeing herself from the doctor—an old friend of the family, who with one hand held her by her thin elbow, and with the other put a bottle of medicine on the table which stood before the sofa. She was glad they held her, because she felt that she ought to do something, but did not know what to do, and was afraid of herself.</p>
				<p>"Don't be so agitated.... Here, take these valerian drops," said the doctor, handing her a glass of turbid liquid.</p>
				<p>She suddenly grew quiet, and, bent almost double, her head drooping on to her hollow chest, she closed her eyes and sank on to the sofa.</p>
				<p>She remembered how, three months ago, her son had taken leave of her with a look of mystery and sorrow on his face. Then she recalled him as an eight-year-old boy, dressed in a velvet jacket, with bare legs and long fair ringlets.</p>
				<p>"And him... him, that very boy... they are going to destroy!..."</p>
				<p>She jumped up, pushing away the table, and tore herself from the doctor; but on reaching the door she again sank on to a chair.</p>
				<p>"And they say there is a God!... What God is He, if He allows it?... May the devil take Him, that God!" she screamed, now sobbing, now breaking into hysterical laughter. "To hang him... who gave up all—his whole career, all his property—to others... gave it all to the people!..." She, who had formerly reproached her son for this, was now speaking of his self-abnegation as a merit. "And him—him... they will do it to him!... And you say there is a God!" she cried.</p>
				<p>"But I do not say anything: I only ask you to take these drops."</p>
				<p>"I want nothing.... Ha, ha, ha!" she laughed and sobbed, beside herself with despair.</p>
				<p>Towards night she was so exhausted with suffering that she could neither speak nor weep, but only stared in front of her with a fixed, insane gaze. The doctor injected morphia, and she fell asleep.</p>
				<p>It was a dreamless sleep, but the awakening was worse than what had gone before. What appeared most terrible was that people could be so cruel: not only those dreadful Generals with their shaved cheeks, and the gendarmes, but everybody, everybody: the maid who came to do the room, with her quiet face, and the people in the next room, who greeted one another cheerfully, and laughed as if nothing had happened.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
				<p>Svetlogoúb had lived through a great deal during the three months of his solitary confinement. From his very childhood he had unconsciously felt the injustice of the exceptional position he held as a rich man; and though he tried to stifle this feeling, often when he came in contact with the poverty of the common people—or sometimes even when he was particularly happy and comfortable himself—he felt rather ashamed of his relation to the people: to peasants, old men, women, and children, who were born, grew up and died, not only without knowing the pleasures he enjoyed, but without even understanding them, and never free from toil and hardship. When he had finished his studies at the University—in order to liberate himself from the consciousness of this injustice—he organized a school in the village on his estate: a model school, a Co-operative Store, and a Home for the aged poor. Yet, strange to say, when occupied with all this, he felt even more ashamed than when he was at supper with his comrades or when he purchased an expensive riding horse. He felt that it was not the right thing, and, even worse than that: there seemed to be something bad about it, something morally impure.</p>
				<p>In one of these fits of disillusionment about his village activities he went to Kief, where he met a fellow-University student. Three years later that fellow-student was shot in the moat of Kief fortress.</p>
				<p>That comrade, an ardent and extremely gifted young man, drew Svetlogoúb into a society the object of which was to enlighten the people, to awaken them to a consciousness of their rights, and to form them into federated groups aiming at freeing the people from the landlords and the Government. His conversation with this man and this man's friends, seemed to ripen into a clear perception all that Svetlogoúb had been vaguely feeling. He understood now what he had to do. Without breaking off his intercourse with his new comrades, he returned to the country, and there began quite a fresh line of activity. He himself took the place of schoolmaster, arranged adult classes, read books and pamphlets to the peasants, and explained to them their true position. Besides all this, he published illegal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-323" id="noteref-323" epub:type="noteref">323</a> books and pamphlets for the people, and gave all that, without taking anything from his mother, he could give for the formation of similar centres in other villages.</p>
				<p>From the first, Svetlogoúb was faced in this activity by two unexpected obstacles: the first was the fact that the majority of the people treated his preaching with indifference, or even with a certain contempt. Only exceptional men (often men of doubtful morality) listened and sympathized with him. The other obstacle came from the side of the Government. They closed his school; and the police searched his house and the dwellings of all who were connected with him, and confiscated books and papers.</p>
				<p>Svetlogoúb was too indignant with the second obstacle—the senseless and humiliating oppression of the Government—to pay much attention to the first. The same was felt by his comrades who were active in other centres, and the feeling of irritation they fomented in one another reached such a pitch of intensity that the great majority of their Group decided to fight the Government by force. The head of that Group was a certain Mezhenétsky, regarded by everybody as a man of indomitable power, incontestable logic, and entirely devoted to the cause of Revolution.</p>
				<p>Svetlogoúb submitted to this man's influence, and with the same energy with which he had worked among the people, now gave himself up to terrorist activity. That activity was dangerous, but the danger more than anything else attracted Svetlogoúb.</p>
				<p>He said to himself: "Victory or martyrdom... and if it is to be martyrdom it will still be victory in the future!" And the fire that had been kindled within him, remained not only unextinguished during the seven years of his revolutionary activity, but fanned by the affection and esteem of those among whom he moved, burned more and more fiercely.</p>
				<p>He attached no importance to the fact that he had given away for the cause almost all his fortune (inherited from his father), nor to the hardships and privations which he often had to encounter in the course of his activity. The only thing that grieved him was the sorrow he was causing to his mother and her ward—a girl who lived with her and loved him.</p>
				<p>At last one of his comrades—a terrorist whom he did not much like, a disagreeable man—when tracked by the police, asked Svetlogoúb to hide some dynamite in his house. Just because he did not like that comrade, Svetlogoúb agreed; and the next day the police searched the house and found the dynamite. When asked how the dynamite had come into his possession, Svetlogoúb refused to answer.</p>
				<p>And now the martyrdom he expected began. At that time, after so many of his friends had been executed, imprisoned, or exiled, and so many women had suffered, Svetlogoúb almost desired martyrdom. During the first moments after his arrest and examination he felt a peculiar exultation and almost joy.</p>
				<p>He felt this while he was being undressed and searched, and while he was being led to prison, and when the iron doors were locked upon him. But when one day passed, and another, and a third, a week, two weeks, three weeks, in the dirty, damp, vermin-infested cell, in loneliness and enforced idleness, varied only by cheerless or bad news, which his comrades and fellow-prisoners communicated by tapping on the walls of their cells; and by occasional examinations by cold, hostile men who tried to torment him into incriminating his comrades, his moral—and with it his physical—strength gradually began to give way. He became despondent and, as he said to himself, longed for this insufferable position to end one way or another. His despondency was aggravated by doubts of his own endurance. In the second month of his incarceration he detected himself thinking of revealing the whole truth: anything to be free! He was appalled at this weakness, but could no longer find in himself his former strength; and, hating and despising himself, became more despondent than ever. But what was most terrible was the fact that, in prison, he began to regret the youthful powers and pleasures he had sacrificed so lightly when he was free, and which now appeared so enchanting that he almost repented of doing what he had once considered right, and sometimes even of the whole of his activity. Thoughts came to him of how happy he would be if he had liberty, living in the country or abroad, free, among loving and beloved friends; how he might marry <em>her</em>, or perhaps another, and with her might live a simple, joyous, bright life.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>
				<p>On one of the painfully monotonous days of the second month of Svetlogoúb's imprisonment, the inspector, while making his daily round, handed him a little book with a gilt cross on its brown binding, saying that the Governor's wife had visited the prison and had left some Testaments, and that permission had been granted to distribute them among the prisoners. Svetlogoúb thanked him, and smiled slightly as he put the book on the little table screwed fast to the wall. When the inspector had gone, Svetlogoúb informed his neighbour by tapping that the inspector had been, and had said nothing new, but had left a Testament. The neighbour replied that he also had received one.</p>
				<p>After dinner Svetlogoúb opened the book, the pages of which stuck together from the damp, and began to read. He had never before read the gospels as a book, and knew them only as he had gone through them with the Scripture teacher at school, and as the priests and deacons chanted them in church.</p>
				<p>"Chapter i.: The book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham... Isaac begat Jacob, Jacob begat Judah..." and he went on to read: "Zorubbabel begat Abiud...."</p>
				<p>All this was just what he expected—some kind of involved, worthless jargon. Had he not been in prison he could not have read a single page to the end; but here he went on reading for the sake of the mechanical act of reading—"Just like Gógol's Petroúsha," he thought to himself. He read the first chapter, about the Virgin Birth and the prophecy which said that the new-born child would be named Emmanuel, which meant "God with us."</p>
				<p>"But where does the prophecy come in?" he thought, and went on reading the second chapter, about the wandering star; and the third, about John who ate locusts; and the fourth, about some devil who suggested to Christ a gymnastic performance from a roof. All this seemed so uninteresting to him that, in spite of the dulness of the prison, he was about to close the book and start on his usual evening occupation—flea-hunting on the shirt he took off—when suddenly he remembered how at an examination of the fifth class at school he had forgotten one of the Beatitudes, and how the rosy-faced, curly-headed priest had suddenly grown angry and given him a bad mark. He could not recollect the text, so he began reading the Beatitudes. "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven," he read. "This might relate also to us," he thought. "Blessed are they that have been persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are ye when men shall reproach you, and persecute you.... Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you. Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost its savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is thenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men."</p>
				<p>"This quite plainly refers to us," he thought, and read farther. When he had read the whole of the fifth chapter, he became thoughtful. "Do not be angry, don't commit adultery, bear with evil, love your enemies.... Yes, if all men lived so," he thought, "there would be no need of revolutions." As he read farther he entered more and more into the spirit of the passages which were quite comprehensible; and the longer he read the more the idea grew on him that something very important was said in that book—something important, simple and touching; something he had never heard before, and which yet seemed to have long been familiar.</p>
				<p>"Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For who soever would save his life shall lose it: and whosoever shall lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what shall a man be profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Matt. xvi. 24, 25, 26).</p>
				<p>"Yes, yes—that is it!" he suddenly exclaimed, with tears in his eyes." That is just what I wished to do.... Yes, I wished just that: just to give my soul, not to keep it safe, but to give it.... That is where joy lies—that is life!... I have done a great deal for other people's sake, for the sake of human approbation—not the approbation of the crowd, but for the good opinion of those I respected and loved: Natásha and Dmítry Shelómof. And then I doubted and was agitated. I felt at ease only when I did something my soul demanded—when I wished to give myself, my whole self."</p>
				<p>From that moment Svetlogoúb spent most of his time reading and pondering what he read in that book. This reading not only evoked in him a glow of tender emotion which carried him beyond the conditions in which he found himself, but also evoked an activity of mind such as he had never before experienced. He wondered why people did not all live as they were told to in that book. "After all, to live so, is good not for one only, but for all. We only need live like that, and there will be no sorrow and no want, only blessedness."</p>
				<p>"If only this would end—if only I could be free once more," he sometimes thought. "After all, they will let me out sooner or later, or send me to penal servitude—no matter which. It is possible to live like that anywhere... and I will live so! I can and must live so... not to live so is madness!"</p>
