			<h2 epub:type="title">Strawberries</h2>
			<p>It was June, and the weather was hot and still. In the forest the foliage was thick, sappy and green, and only rarely did a yellow leaf fall here and there from a birch or a lime-tree. The wild-rose bushes were covered with sweet blossoms; and the forest glades were a mass of honey-scented clover. The thick, tall and waving rye was growing darker, and its grain was swelling fast. In the low-lying land the corncrakes called to one another; in the rye and the oat field quails croaked and cried noisily; in the forests at rare intervals the nightingales sang a few notes and then were again silent. The heat was dry and scorching, and the dust lay an inch thick on the road, or rose in dense clouds, blown now to left and now to right by a stray gentle breeze.</p>
			<p>The peasants were working to finish their buildings or were carting manure. The hungry cattle were out on the dry fallow land, awaiting the aftermath in the hayfields. The cows and calves were lowing, and, with uplifted hooked tails, abandoned their shady resting-places to scamper away from the herdsmen. By the road-side and on the banks, lads were pasturing horses; women were carrying sacks of grass out of the woods; young maidens and little girls, hurrying after one another, crept between the bushes where the trees were felled, picking strawberries to sell to the gentlefolk who had come to the country for the summer.</p>
			<p>These summer inhabitants of ornamented, architecturally pretentious bungalows, strolled with open sunshades, in light, clean, costly clothes, along sand-strewn paths; or sat in the shade of trees and arbours, by decorated tables, and, overpowered by the heat, drank tea or sipped cooling drinks.</p>
			<p>Before the splendid bungalow of Nicholas Semyónovitch, with its tower, veranda, little balconies and galleries (everything about it fresh, new, and clean), stood a troika-calèche with three horses, that had brought a Petersburg gentleman from the town six miles off.</p>
			<p>This gentleman—a well-known and active Liberal member of every Committee—was on every Council, and signed every petition and every address—cunningly framed to appear faithfully loyal, but really very radical. He had come from the town (in which, as an extremely busy man, he was staying only twenty-four hours) to see the old friend and playmate of his childhood, who was almost his adherent.</p>
			<p>They disagreed only on the best way of putting their Constitutional principles into practice; and as to that but slightly. The Petersburger was more of a European—even with a slight leaning towards Socialism—and in receipt of a very large salary from the different posts he occupied. Nicholas Semyónovitch, on the other hand, was a pure Russian, Orthodox, a bit of a Slavophil, and the owner of many thousands of acres.</p>
			<p>They had had five courses for dinner, which was served in the garden; but the heat made it almost impossible to eat, so that all the work of the cook (who received £50 a year) and of his assistants, who had taken special trouble to prepare dinner for the visitor, was wasted. They had only eaten of the iced fish-soup, and the parti-coloured, prettily shaped ice-pudding, elaborately ornamented with spun sugar and biscuits. Besides the visitor, there had been present at dinner a Liberal doctor, the children's tutor—a desperately Socialistic, Revolutionary student (but whom Nicholas Semyónovitch was able to keep within bounds)—Nicholas Semyónovitch's wife, Marie, and their three children; the youngest of whom came only to dessert.</p>
			<p>There had been a slight strain during dinner, because Marie, a very nervous woman, was anxious about the derangement of Gógo's stomach (as is the custom among well-bred people, the name "Gógo" was given to their youngest son, Nicholas), and also because, as soon as a political subject was started by Nicholas Semyónovitch and the visitors, the desperate student—in his eagerness to show that he was not afraid of expressing his opinions to anyone—broke into the conversation. Then the visitor would cease talking, and Nicholas Semyónovitch would try to soothe the student.</p>
			<p>They had dined at seven; and after dinner the friends sat on the veranda, refreshing themselves by sipping iced <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">narzán</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-311" id="noteref-311" epub:type="noteref">311</a> with white wine, and conversing.</p>
			<p>Their difference of opinion first showed itself on the question of elections: as to whether direct or secondary representation was better—and the discussion was growing heated when they were called to tea in the dining-room, which was carefully protected from the flies by nets. The conversation at tea was general, and directed to Marie, who could take no interest in it because her thoughts were absorbed by some symptoms of the derangement of Gógo's digestive organs. They were talking about pictures, and Marie maintained that in decadent art there was a certain je ne sais quoi: which could not be denied. She was at that moment not thinking in the least about decadent art, but only repeating what she had often said before. As for the visitor, he did not care about it at all, but he had heard what was being said against decadence, and repeated it so naturally that no one could have guessed that neither decadence nor non-decadence concerned him in the least; and Nicholas Semyónovitch, looking at his wife, felt that she was dissatisfied about something, and that some unpleasantness might be expected—and, besides, it was very dull listening to what she was saying. He thought he must have heard it at least a hundred times.</p>
			<p>Rich bronze lamps were lit inside the room, and lanterns outside. The children had been put to bed; Gógo having first been subjected to medical treatment.</p>
			<p>The visitor, with Nicholas Semyónovitch and the doctor, went out on to the veranda. The footman brought candles with glass globes, and more <i xml:lang="ru-Latn">narzán</i>, and about midnight they started at last a real, animated conversation as to the best means of government to be adopted at the present, most critical, time for Russia. They all smoked and talked unceasingly.</p>
			<p>Outside the gate clanked the bells on the harness of the horses, which had not been fed, and the old driver, sitting inside the calèche, alternately yawned and snored. He had worked for one master twenty years; and with the exception of three to five roubles a month, which he drank, he had sent all his money home to his brother, who worked their land in the village. When the cocks began to crow to one another from bungalow to bungalow (especially one from a neighbouring yard, who had a very loud shrill voice) the driver began to wonder whether they had forgotten him, and got down and went inside the gate. He saw his fare sitting, eating and talking. He became alarmed, and went to look for the footman. He found him in his livery, sitting asleep in the ante-room. The driver woke him up. The footman, formerly a serf, kept his large family out of his wages (it was a good place: he got £20 a year wages, and sometimes another £10 in tips); he had five girls and two boys. He jumped up, pulled himself together with a shake, and went to tell the gentleman that the driver was getting uneasy and asking to be dismissed.</p>
			<p>When the footman entered, the discussion was at its height. The doctor also was taking part in it.</p>
			<p>"I cannot admit that the Russian people..." the visitor was saying, "ought to develop on different lines. Before all things liberty is wanted—political liberty—that liberty... as all know well, is the greatest liberty... without infringing the rights of others."</p>
			<p>He felt that he was getting a little mixed, and that that was not the right way to put it; but he could not quite remember how it should be put.</p>
			<p>"That is so," answered Nicholas Semyónovitch, anxious to express his own thought, with which he was particularly pleased, and not listening to the visitor—"that is so, but it must be reached by other means—not by a majority of votes, but by common consent. Look at the Mír, how it arrives at its decisions!"</p>
			<p>"Oh, that Mír!"</p>
			<p>"It cannot be denied," said the doctor, "that the Slavonic nations have an outlook of their own. Take, for instance, the Polish right of veto. I don't maintain that it is a better way..."</p>
			<p>"One moment... I will finish what I was going to say," began Nicholas Semyónovitch. "The Russian people have special characteristics. These characteristics..."</p>
			<p>But here Iván, the liveried, sleepy-eyed foot-man, interrupted him.</p>
			<p>"The driver is getting uneasy," he said.</p>
			<p>"Please tell him" (the Petersburg visitor always spoke politely to footmen, and prided himself on doing so) "that I shall soon be going, and will pay for the extra time."</p>
			<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
			<p>The footman went away, and Nicholas Semyónovitch was able to finish expressing his view. But both the visitor and the doctor had heard him express it a score of times (or, at any rate, they thought so), and began disproving it, especially the visitor, who quoted instances from history. He knew history very thoroughly.</p>
			<p>The doctor sided with the visitor, admired his erudition, and was glad of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with him.</p>
			<p>While they were engrossed in their subject the dawn appeared behind the wood on the opposite side of the road, and the birds woke up, but the arguers still kept on smoking and talking, talking and smoking, and the conversation might have gone on still longer, if a maidservant had not appeared at the door.</p>
			<p>This servant was an orphan, who had had to take service to earn her living. She had first gone into a tradesman's house, where one of his assistants seduced her, and she had had a child. The child died, and she entered the house of an official whose son—a gymnasium student—gave her no peace; and now she was under-housemaid in Nicholas Semyónovitch's family, and considered herself fortunate because she was not pursued by her master's lust, and had her wages paid regularly. She came to say that her mistress wanted the doctor and Nicholas Semyónovitch.</p>
			<p>"Oh dear!..." thought Nicholas Semyónovitch, "something must be wrong with Gógo."</p>
			<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>
			<p>"Nicholas Nikoláyevitch seems unwell." Nicholas Nikoláyevitch—that was little Gógo, who had overeaten himself, and was now suffering from diarrhœa.</p>
			<p>"And it's high time for me to be going," said the visitor. " Just look how light it is... how long we have been sitting here!" He smiled (as if approving of himself and his collocutors for having talked so much and so long) and took his leave.</p>
