					<p>Six months have passed since the first cannon ball whistled from the bastions of Sevastopol and threw up the earth of the enemy's entrenchments. Since then bullets, balls, and bombs by the thousand have been flying continually from the bastions to the entrenchments, and from the entrenchments to the bastions, and above them the angel of death has hovered unceasingly.</p>
					<p>Thousands of human ambitions have had time to be wounded, thousands to be gratified and to expand, thousands to be lulled to rest in the arms of death. So many pink coffins and linen palls! And yet the same sounds from the bastions fill the air; still the French from their camp look with involuntary trepidation and fear at the yellowy earth of the bastions of Sevastopol, and count the embrasures from which the iron cannon frown fiercely; still the pilot from the elevation of the signal-station watches, as before, through the fixed telescope the bright-coloured figures of the French: their batteries, tents, their columns moving on the green hill, the puffs of smoke that rise from the entrenchments; and still, from many parts of the world, with the same ardour, crowds of different men, with still more different desires, stream to this fatal spot. But the question the diplomatists have not settled still remains unsolved by powder and blood.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>
					<p>In the besieged town of Sevastopol a regimental band played on the boulevard near the pavilion, and crowds of women and military men strolled along the paths making holiday. The bright spring sun had risen in the morning above the English entrenchments, had reached the bastions, then the town, the Nicholas Barracks, shining with equal joy on all, and was now sinking towards the distant blue sea, which, rocking in even motion, glittered with silvery light.</p>
					<p>A tall infantry officer with a slight stoop, drawing on a presentable though not very white glove, passed out of the gate of one of the small sailors' houses built on the left side of the Morskáya Street, and, gazing thoughtfully at the ground, ascended the hill towards the boulevard. The expression of his plain face did not reveal great intellectual power, but rather good-nature, common-sense, honesty, and an inclination towards respectability. He was badly built, and seemed a bit shy and awkward in his movements. He wore a nearly new cap, a thin cloak of a rather peculiar lilacky shade, from under which was visible a gold watch-chain, trousers with foot-straps, and clean, shiny calf-skin boots. He might have been a German (but that his features indicated his purely Russian origin), or an adjutant, or a regimental quartermaster (but in that case he would have had spurs), or an officer transferred for the campaign from the cavalry or the Guards. He was, in fact, an officer who had exchanged from the cavalry, and as he ascended the hill towards the boulevard, he was thinking of a letter he had received from proprietor of the government of T⁠⸺, and of his great friend, that comrade's wife, the pale, blue-eyed Natásha. He recalled one part of the letter, where his comrade wrote:—</p>
					<p>“When we receive the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Invalide</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> Póupka” (so the retired Uhlan called his wife) “rushes headlong into the hall, seizes the paper, and runs with it to a seat in the <em>arbour</em> or the <em>drawing-room</em> (in which, you remember, we spent such jolly winter evenings when your regiment was stationed in our town), and reads of <em>your</em> heroic deeds with an ardour you cannot imagine. She often speaks of you. 'There now,' she says, 'Miháylof is a <em>darling</em>. I am ready to cover him with kisses when I see him. He is <em>fighting on the bastions</em>, and is certain to get a <abbr>St.</abbr> George's Cross, and they'll write about him in the papers,' <abbr>etc.</abbr>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, so that I am beginning to be quite jealous of you."</p>
					<p>In another place he wrote: “The papers reach us awfully late, and though there are plenty of rumours, one cannot believe them all. For instance, those <em>young ladies with music</em> you know of were saying yesterday that Napoleon has been captured by our Cossacks and sent to <abbr>St.</abbr> Petersburg; but you can guess how much of this I believe. One fresh arrival from Petersburg tells us for certain (he is sent by the Minister on special business, a capital fellow, and now there is no one in the town you can't think what a <em>resource</em> he is to us), that we have taken Eupatoria, <em>so that the French are cut off from Balaclava</em>, and that we lost 200 in the affair and the French as many as 15,000. The wife was in such raptures that she <em>caroused</em> all night, and said that a presentiment made her certain you have distinguished yourself in that affair.”</p>
					<p>In spite of the words and expressions I have purposely underlined, and the whole tone of the letter, Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof thought with an inexpressibly melancholy pleasure of his pale-faced provincial friend, and how in the evening he used to sit with her in the arbour talking <em>sentiment</em>. He thought of his kind comrade the Uhlan; how the latter used to get angry and lose when they played cards in the study for <i xml:lang="ru">kopéyka</i> points, and how his wife used to laugh at him. He recalled the friendship these people had for him (perhaps he thought there was something more on the side of the pale-faced friend): these people and their surroundings flitted through his memory in a wonderfully sweet, joyously rosy light, and, smiling at the recollection, he put his hand to the pocket where this <em>dear</em> letter lay.</p>
					<p>From these recollections Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof involuntarily passed to dreams and hopes. “How surprised and pleased Natásha will be," he thought as he passed along a narrow side-street, “when she reads in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Invalide</i> of my being the first to climb on the cannon, and receiving the <abbr>St.</abbr> George! I ought to be made full Captain on that former recommendation. Then I may easily become Major already this year by seniority, because so many of our fellows have been killed, and no doubt many more will be killed this campaign. Then there'll be more fighting, and I, as a well-known man, shall be entrusted with a regiment ... then Lieutenant-Colonel, the order of <em>St.</em> Anne ... a Colonel” ... and he was already a General, honouring with a visit Natasha, the widow of his comrade (who would be dead by that time according to the day-dream), when the sounds of the music on the boulevard reached his ears more distinctly, a crowd of people appeared before his eyes, and he awoke on the boulevard a Lieutenant-Captain of infantry as before.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
					<p>He went first to the pavilion, near which was the band. Instead of music-stands, other soldiers of the same regiment were holding the music-books open before the players, and, looking on rather than listening, stood a circle of clerks, junkers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a> and nursemaids with children. Most of the people who were standing, sitting, and sauntering round the pavilion were naval officers, adjutants, and white-gloved army officers. Along the broad avenue of the boulevard walked officers of all sorts and women of all sorts—a few of the latter in hats, but the greater part with kerchiefs on their heads (and some without either kerchiefs or hats)—but it was remarkable that there was not single old woman amongst them—all were young. Lower down, in the scented alleys shaded by the white acacias, isolated groups sat or strolled.</p>
					<p>No one was particularly glad to meet Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof on the boulevard, except, perhaps, Captain Obzhógof of his regiment, and Captain Soúslikof, who pressed his hand warmly; but the first of these wore camel's-hair trousers, no gloves, and a shabby overcoat, and his face was red and perspiring, and the second shouted so loud, and was so free and easy, that one felt ashamed to be seen walking with him, especially by those white-gloved officers (to one of them, an Adjutant, Miháylof bowed, and he might have bowed to another, a Staff-Officer whom he had twice met at the house of a mutual acquaintance). Besides, what was the fun of walking with Obzhógof and Soúslikof, when, as it was, he met them and shook hands with them six times a day? Was this what he had come to hear <em>the music</em> for?</p>
					<p>He would have liked to accost the Adjutant whom he had bowed to, and to talk with those gentlemen; not at all that he wanted Captains Obzhógof and Soúslikof and Lieutenant Pashtétsky and others to see him talking to them, but simply because they were pleasant people, who knew all the news, and might have told him something.</p>
					<p>But why is Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof afraid, and unable to muster courage to approach them? "And supposing they don't return my greeting,” he thinks, "or merely bow and go on talking among themselves as if I were not there, or simply walk away and leave me standing among the <em>aristocrats</em>?” The word aristocrats (in the sense of the highest, select circle of any class) has lately gained great popularity in Russia, where one would think it ought not to exist. It has made its way to every part of the country and into every grade of society that is reached by vanity (and to what conditions of time and circumstance does this pitiful propensity not reach?). It is found among merchants, officials, clerks, officers,—in Sarátof, Mamadíshi, Vínnitza: wherever men are found. And since in the besieged town of Sevastopol there are many men, and consequently much vanity, the aristocrats are here also, though death hangs over each one, be he aristocrat or not.</p>
					<p>To Captain Obzhógof, Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof was an aristocrat, and to Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof, Adjutant Kaloúgin was an aristocrat, because he was an adjutant and intimate with another adjutant. To Adjutant Kaloúgin, Count Nórdof was an aristocrat, because he was an aide-de-camp to the Emperor.</p>
					<p>Vanity! vanity! vanity! everywhere, even on the brink of the grave and among men ready to die for a lofty cause. Vanity! It seems to be the characteristic feature and special malady of our time. How is it that among our predecessors no mention was made of this passion, as of small-pox and cholera? How is it that in our time there are only three kinds of people: those who, considering vanity an inevitably existing fact and therefore justifiable, freely submit to it; those who regard it as a sad but unavoidable condition; and those who act unconsciously and slavishly under its influence? Why did our Homers and Shakespears speak of love, glory, and suffering, while the literature of to-day is an endless story of snobbery and vanity?</p>
					<p>Twice the Lieutenant-Captain passed irresolutely by the group of <em>his aristocrats</em>, but drawing near them for the third time he made an effort and walked up to them. The group consisted of four officers: Adjutant Kaloúgin, Miháylof's acquaintance; Adjutant Prince Gáltsin, who was rather an aristocrat even for Kaloúgin himself; Lieutenant-Colonel Nefyórdof, one of the so-called “two hundred and twenty-two” society men (who, being on the retired list, re-entered the army for this war); and Cavalry Captain Praskoúhin, also of the “two hundred and twenty-two." Luckily for Miháylof, Kaloúgin was in splendid spirits (the General had just spoken to him in a very confidential manner, and Prince Gáltsin, who had arrived from Petersburg, was staying with him), so he did not think it beneath his dignity to shake hands with Miháylof, which was more than Praskoúhin did, though he had often met Miháylof on the bastion, had more than once drunk his wine and <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i>, and even owed him twelve and a half roubles lost at cards. Not being yet well acquainted with Prince Gáltsin, he did not like to appear to be acquainted with a mere lieutenant-captain of infantry. So he only bowed slightly.</p>
					<p>“Well, Captain,” said Kaloúgin, “when will you be visiting the bastion again? Do you remember our meeting at the Schwartz Redoubt? Things were hot, weren't they, eh?"</p>
					<p>“Yes, very,” said Miháylof, and he remembered how, when making his way along the trench to the bastion, he had met Kaloúgin, walking along courageously, and smartly clanking his sabre.</p>
					<p>"My turn's to-morrow by rights, but we have an officer ill,” continued Miháylof, "so—"</p>
					<p>He wanted to say that it was not his turn, but as the Commander of the 8th Company was ill, and only the Ensign was left in the company, he felt it his duty to offer to go in place of Lieutenant Nepshisétsky, and would therefore be at the bastion that evening. But Kaloúgin did not hear him out.</p>
					<p>“I feel sure that something is going to happen in a day or two,” he said to Prince Gáltsin.</p>
					<p>“How about to-day? will nothing happen to-day?” Miháylof asked shyly, looking first at Kaloúgin and then at Gáltsin.</p>
					<p>No one replied. Prince Gáltsin only puckered up his face in a curious way, and looking over Miháylof's cap, said, after a short silence—</p>
					<p>"Fine girl that, with the red kerchief. Don't you know her, Captain?"</p>
					<p>“She lives near my lodgings, she's a sailor's daughter," answered the Lieutenant-Captain.</p>
					<p>“Come, let's have a good look at her.”</p>
					<p>And Prince Gáltsin gave one of his arms to Kaloúgin and the other to the Lieutenant-Captain, knowing he would thereby confer great pleasure on the latter, as was really the case.</p>
					<p>The Lieutenant-Captain was superstitious, and considered it a great sin to amuse himself with women before going into action; but on this occasion he pretended to be a <i xml:lang="fr">roué</i>, which Prince Gáltsin and Kaloúgin evidently did not believe, and which greatly surprised the girl with the red kerchief, who had more than once noticed how the Lieutenant-Captain blushed when he passed her window. Praskoúhin walked behind them, and kept touching Prince Gáltsin's arm and making various remarks in French; but as four people could not walk abreast on the path, he was obliged to go alone, until, on the second round, he took the arm of a well-known brave naval officer, Servyágin, who came up and spoke to him, being also anxious to join the aristocrats. And the well-known hero gladly passed his honest, muscular hand under the elbow of Praskoúhin, whom everybody, including especially Servyágin himself, knew to be a man no better than he should be. When (wishing to explain to Prince Gáltsin his acquaintance with this sailor) Praskoúhin whispered that this was the well-known hero, Prince Gáltsin, who had been in the Fourth Bastion the day before and had seen a shell burst at some twenty yards' distance, considering himself not less courageous than the newcomer and believing that many reputations are obtained by luck, paid not the slightest attention to Servyágin.</p>
					<p>Lieutenant-Captain Miháylof found it so pleasant to walk in this company that he forgot his <em>dear</em> letter from T⁠⸺, and his gloomy forebodings at the thought of having to go to the bastion. He remained with them till they began talking exclusively among themselves, avoiding his eyes to show that he might go, and at last walked away from him. But, all the same, the Lieutenant-Captain was contented, and when he passed Junker Baron Pesth, who was particularly conceited and self-satisfied since the previous night (when for the first time in his life he had been in the bomb-proof of the Fifth Bastion, and had consequently become a hero in his own estimation), he (the Captain) was not at all hurt by the suspiciously haughty expression with which the Junker saluted him.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>
					<p>But hardly had the Lieutenant-Captain crossed the threshold of his lodgings, when very different thoughts entered his head. He saw his little room with its uneven earth floor, its crooked windows, the broken panes mended with paper, his old bedstead with two Toúla pistols and a rug (showing a lady on horseback) nailed to the wall above it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a> as well as the dirty bed of the Junker who lived with him, with its cotton quilt. He saw his man, Nikíta, with his rough, greasy hair, rise, scratching himself, from the floor; he saw his old cloak, his common boots, a little bundle tied in a handkerchief, prepared for him to take to the bastion, from which peeped a bit of cheese and the neck of a porter bottle containing <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i>,—and he suddenly remembered that he had to go with his company to spend the whole of the night at the lodgments.</p>
					<p>“I shall certainly be killed to-night,” thought the Lieutenant-Captain; "I feel I shall. And really there was no need for me to go,–I offered of my own accord. And it's always so: the one who offers himself always does get killed. And what is the matter with that confounded Nepshisétsky? He may not be ill at all; and they'll go and kill a man because of him—they certainly will. However, if they don't kill me I shall surely be recommended for promotion. I saw how pleased the Regimental Commander was when I said, 'Allow me to go if Lieutenant Nepshisétsky is ill.' If I'm not made a Major, then I'll get the Order of Vladímir for certain. Why, I am going to the bastion for the thirteenth time. Oh dear, the thirteenth! unlucky number! I am certain to be killed; I feel I shall;... but somebody had to go: the company can't go with only an Ensign. Supposing something was to happen.... Why, the honour of the regiment, the honour of the army is at stake. It is my <em>duty</em> to go. Yes, my sacred duty.... But I have a presentiment."</p>
					<p>The Lieutenant-Captain forgot that it was not the first time he had felt this presentiment: that, in a greater or lesser degree, he had it whenever he was going to the bastion, and he did not know that, more or less strongly, every one has such forebodings before going into action. Having calmed himself by appealing to his sense of duty—which was highly developed in him and very strong—the Lieutenant-Captain sat down to the table and began writing a farewell letter to his father. Ten minutes later, having finished his letter, he rose from the table, his eyes wet with tears, and, repeating mentally all the prayers he knew, he began to dress. His rather tipsy and rude servant lazily handed him his new cloak (the old one, which the Lieutenant-Captain usually wore at the bastion, was not mended).</p>
					<p>“Why is my cloak not mended? You do nothing but sleep," said Miháylof angrily.</p>
					<p>“How sleep?" grumbled Nikíta; one does nothing but run about like a dog the whole day—gets fagged, and mayn't even fall asleep!”</p>
					<p>“I see you are again drunk.”</p>
					<p>“It's not on your money if I am, so you needn't scold me.”</p>
					<p>“Hold your tongue, blockhead!” shouted the Lieutenant-Captain, ready to strike the man.</p>
					<p>Upset before, he was now quite out of patience and offended at the rudeness of Nikíta, whom he was fond of, and even spoilt, and who had lived with him for the last twelve years.</p>
					<p>“Blockhead? blockhead?” repeated the servant. “And why do you, sir, abuse me and call me blockhead? You know what times these are? It is not right to scold.”</p>
					<p>Miháylof remembered where he was going, and felt ashamed.</p>
					<p>“But you know, Nikíta, you would try any one's patience!” he said mildly. That letter on the table to my father you may leave where it is; don't touch it,” he added, reddening.</p>
					<p>“Yes, sir,” said Nikíta, becoming sentimental under the influence of the <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i> he had drunk, as he said, on his own money, and blinking with an evident inclination to weep.</p>
					<p>But when, at the porch, the Lieutenant-Captain said “Good-bye, Nikíta,” Nikíta burst into forced sobs and rushed to kiss his master's hand, saying “Good-bye, sir,” in a broken voice. A sailor's widow who also stood at the porch could not, as a woman, help joining in this tender scene, and began wiping her eyes on her dirty sleeve, saying something about people who, though they were gentlefolks, took such sufferings upon themselves, while she, poor woman, was left a widow. And she told the tipsy Nikíta for the hundredth time about her sorrows; how her husband had been killed in the first <em>bandagement</em>, and how her hut had been shattered (the one she lived in now was not her own), and so on. After his master was gone, Nikíta lit his pipe, asked the landlady's little girl to go for some <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i>, very soon left off crying, and even had a quarrel with the old woman about a pail which he said she had smashed.</p>
					<p>“But perhaps I shall only be wounded,” reasoned the Lieutenant-Captain with himself, arriving at the bastion with his company in the twilight. "But where? and how?—here or here?” he said to himself, mentally pointing to his chest and his stomach. “Supposing it were here” (he thought of his thighs) “and went right round?... But suppose it's here, and with a piece of a bomb, then it's all up.”</p>
					<p>The Lieutenant-Captain, passing along the trenches, safely reached the lodgments. It was in perfect darkness that he and a sapper-officer set the men to their work, after which he sat down in a hole under the breastwork. There was little firing; only now and again on our side or <em>his</em> there was a lightning flash, and the brilliant fuse of a bomb formed a fiery arc on the dark, star-speckled sky. But all the bombs fell far beyond or far to the right of the lodgment where the Lieutenant-Captain sat in his hole. He drank some <i xml:lang="ru">vódka</i>, ate some cheese, smoked a cigarette, prayed, and felt inclined for sleep.</p>

					<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>
					<p>Prince Gáltsin, Lieutenant-Colonel Nefyórdof, and Praskoúhin, whom no one had invited and with whom no one spoke, but who yet stuck to them, went to Kaloúgin's to tea.</p>
					<p>“But you did not finish telling me about Váska Méndel," said Kaloúgin, when he had taken off his cloak, and sat in a soft easy-chair by the window unbuttoning the collar of his clean, starched shirt. "How did he get married?”</p>
					<p>“It was a joke, my boy!... <i xml:lang="fr">Je vous dis, il y avait un temps, on ne parlait que de ça à Petersbourg</i>,"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-37" id="noteref-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a> said Prince Gáltsin, laughing, as he jumped up from the piano-stool and sat down near Kaloúgin on the window-sill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a> “a capital joke. I know all about it.”... And he told, amusingly, cleverly, and with animation, some love story which we will omit, as it does not interest us.</p>
					<p>It was noticeable that not only Prince Gáltsin but each of these gentlemen who established themselves, one on the window-sill, another with his legs in the air, and a third by the piano, seemed quite different people now to what they had been on the boulevard. There was none of the absurd arrogance and haughtiness which they had shown towards the infantry officers; here among themselves they were natural, and Kaloúgin and Prince Gáltsin in particular showed themselves very nice, merry, and good-natured young fellows. Their conversation was about their Petersburg fellow-officers and acquaintances.</p>
					<p>“What of Máslofsky?"</p>
					<p>“Which one?—the Leib-Uhlan or the Horse Guard?”</p>
					<p>“I know them both. The one in the Horse Guards I knew when he was a boy just out of school. But the eldest—is he a captain yet?”</p>
					<p>“Oh yes, long ago."</p>
					<p>"Is he still fussing about with his gipsy?"</p>
					<p>“No, he has dropped her...." And so on, in the same strain.</p>
					<p>Later on Prince Gáltsin went to the piano, and sang a gipsy song capitally. Praskoúhin, chiming in, put in a second unasked, and did it so well that he was invited to continue, and this delighted him.</p>
					<p>A servant brought tea, cream, and cracknels on a silver tray.</p>
					<p>"Serve the Prince," said Kaloúgin.</p>
					<p>“Is it not strange to think," said Gáltsin, taking his tea to the window, “that we're in a besieged town, and here's a <em>pi-aner-forty</em>, tea with cream, and a house such as I should really be glad to have in Petersburg?"</p>
					<p>“Why, if we had not even that,” said the old, always dissatisfied Lieutenant-Colonel, “the continual uncertainty we are living in—seeing people killed day after day, and no end to it, would be intolerable. And to have dirt and discomfort added to it—"</p>
					<p>“But our infantry officers,” said Kaloúgin, “they live at the bastions with their men in the bomb-proofs, and eat soldiers' soup—what of them?”</p>
					<p>“What of them? Well, though it's true they wear the same shirt for ten days at a time, they are heroes all the same—wonderful men."</p>
					<p>Just then an infantry officer entered the room.</p>
					<p>“I... I have orders... may I see the Gen... his Excellency? I have come with a message from General N.,” he said, bowing shyly.</p>
					<p>Kaloúgin rose, and, not returning the officer's bow, asked with an offensive, affected official smile if he would not have the goodness to wait; and without asking him to sit down or taking any further notice of him, turned to Gáltsin and began talking French, so that the poor officer, left alone in the middle of the room, did not in the least know what to do with himself.</p>
					<p>“It is a matter of the utmost urgency, sir,” said the officer, after a short silence.</p>
					<p>“Ah! well, then, come if you please,” said Kaloúgin, putting on his cloak, and accompanying the officer to the door.</p>
					<hr/>
					<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Eh bien, messieurs, je crois, que cela chauffera cette nuit</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a> said Kaloúgin, when he returned from the General's.</p>
					<p>"Ah! what is it?—a sortie?” asked the others.</p>
					<p>“That I don't know; you will see for yourselves," replied Kaloúgin, with a mysterious smile.</p>
					<p>“And my commander is at the bastion, so I suppose I must go too,” said Praskoúhin, buckling on his sabre.</p>
					<p>No one replied; it was his business to know whether he had to go or not.</p>
					<p>Praskoúhin and Nefyórdof left, to go to their appointed posts.</p>
					<p>“Good-bye, gentlemen. Au revoir! We'll meet again before the night is over,” shouted Kaloúgin from the window, as Praskoúhin and Nefyórdof, stooping in their Cossack saddles, trotted past. The tramp of their Cossack horses soon died away in the dark street.</p>
					<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Non, dites moi, est-ce qu'il y aura véritablement quelque chose cette nuit?</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a> said Gáltsin, as he lounged in the window-sill beside Kaloúgin, and watched the bombs that rose above the bastions.</p>
					<p>“I can tell <em>you</em>, you see ... you have been to the bastions? (Gáltsin nodded, though he had only once been to the Fourth Bastion.) You remember just in front of our lunette there is a trench,”... and Kalougin, with the air of one who without being a specialist considers his military judgment very sound, began somewhat confusedly, and misusing the technical terms, to explain the position of the enemy and of our own works, and the plan of the intended action.</p>
					<p>“But, I say, they're banging away at the lodgments. Oho! I wonder if that is ours or <em>his?</em>... Now it's burst,” said they, as they lounged on the window-sill looking at the fiery trails of the bombs crossing one another in the air, at flashes that for a moment lit up the dark sky, at the puffs of white smoke, and listened to the more and more frequent reports of the firing.</p>
					<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Quel charmant coup d'œil! a?</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-41" id="noteref-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a> said Kaloúgin, drawing his guest's attention to the really beautiful sight. “Do you know, you sometimes can't distinguish a bomb from a star.”</p>
					<p>“Yes, I thought that was a star just now, and then saw it fall ... there! it's burst. And that big star—what do you call it?—looks just like a bomb."</p>
					<p>“Do you know, I am so used to these bombs that I am sure when I'm back in Russia I shall think I see bombs every starlight night—one gets so used to them.”</p>
					<p>“But had not I better join this sortie?” said Prince Gáltsin, after a moment's pause.</p>
					<p>"Humbug! my dear fellow! don't think of such a thing! Besides, I won't let you, " answered Kalougin. “You will have plenty of opportunities later on!”</p>
					<p>"Really? You think I need not go, eh?”</p>
					<p>At that moment, from the direction in which these gentlemen were looking, amid the boom of the cannon came the terrible rattle of musketry, and thousands of little fires, flaming up in quick succession, flashed all along the line.</p>
					<p>“There! now it's the real thing!” said Kalougin. “I can't keep cool when I hear the noise of muskets; it seems, you know, to seize one's very soul. There's an <em>hurrah</em>!” he added, listening intently to the distant and prolonged roar of hundreds of voices, “Ah—ah—ah,” which came from the bastions.</p>
					<p>"Whose <em>hurrah</em> was it? theirs or ours?”</p>
					<p>“I don't know, but it's hand-to-hand fighting now, for the firing has ceased.”</p>
					<p>At that moment an officer, followed by a Cossack, galloped under the window and alighted from his horse at the porch.</p>
					<p>"Where from?”</p>
					<p>“From the bastion. I want the General."</p>
					<p>“Come along. Well, what's happened?"</p>
					<p>“The lodgments have been attacked—and occupied—the French brought up tremendous reserves—attacked us—we had only two battalions," said the officer, panting. He was the same officer who had been there that evening, but though he was now out of breath, he walked with full self-possession to the door.</p>
					<p>“Well, have we retreated?" asked Kaloúgin.</p>
					<p>“No,” angrily replied the officer; “another battalion came up in time—we drove them back, but the Colonel is killed and many officers. I have orders to ask for reinforcements.”</p>
					<p>And, saying this, he went with Kaloúgin to the General's, where we shall not follow him.</p>
					<p>Five minutes later Kaloúgin was already on his Cossack horse (again in the semi-Cossack manner which I have noticed that all Adjutants, for some reason, seem to consider the proper thing), and rode off at a trot towards the bastion to deliver some orders and await the final result of the affair. Prince Gáltsin, under the influence of that oppressive excitement usually produced in a spectator by proximity to an action in which he is not engaged, went out and began aimlessly pacing up and down the street.</p>

					<p>Soldiers passed, carrying the wounded on stretchers or leading them under their arms. It was quite dark in the streets; only here and there one saw lights, in the hospital windows or where some officers were sitting up. From the bastions still came the thunder of cannon and the rattle of muskets,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a> and the lights continued to flash in the dark sky as before. From time to time you heard trampling hoofs as an orderly galloped past, or the groans of a wounded man, the steps and voices of stretcher-bearers, or the words of some frightened women who had come out into their porches to watch the cannonade.</p>
					<p>Among the spectators were our friend Nikíta, the old sailor's widow, with whom he had again made friends, and her ten-year-old daughter.</p>
					<p>“O Lord God! Holy Mary, Mother of God!” said the old woman, sighing, as she looked at the bombs that kept flying across from side to side like balls of fire; "what horrors! what horrors! Ah, ah! oh, oh! Even at the first <em>bandagement</em> it wasn't like that. Look now, where the cursed thing has burst, just over our house in the suburb.”</p>
					<p>“No, that's further, they keep tumbling into Aunt Irena's garden," said the girl.</p>
					<p>“And where, where is master now?” drawled Nikíta, who was not quite sober yet. “Oh! how I love that 'ere master of mine even I myself don't know. I love him so that, should he be killed in a sinful way, which God forbid, then, would you believe it, granny, after that I myself don't know what I wouldn't do to myself! S'elp me, I don't!... My master is that sort, there's only one word for it. Could one change him for such as them there, playing cards? What are they? Ugh! there's only one word for it!” concluded Nikíta, pointing to the lighted window of his master's room, to which, in the absence of the Lieutenant-Captain, the Junker Zhvadchévsky had invited Sub-Lieutenants Ougróvich and Nepshisétsky (whose face was swollen), and was having a spree in honour of a medal he had received.</p>
					<p>“Look at the stars, look at 'em, how they're rolling!” The little girl broke the silence that followed Nikíta's words. She stood gazing at the sky. “Here's another rolled down. What is it a sign of, eh, mother?”</p>
					<p>“They'll smash up our hut altogether,” said the old woman with a sigh, leaving her daughter unanswered.</p>
					<p>“As we went there to-day with uncle, mother,” continued, in a sing-song tone, the little girl, who had become talkative, “there was such a b—i—g cannon-ball inside the room, close to the cupboard. <em>A'spose</em> it had smashed in through the passage, and right into the room, such a big one—you couldn't lift it."</p>
					<p>“Those who had husbands and money all moved away,” said the old woman, “and there's the hut, all that was left me, and that's been smashed. Just look at <em>him</em> blazing away! The fiend!... O Lord, O Lord!”</p>
					<p>“And just as we were going out, comes a bomb fly—ing, and goes and bur—sts and co—o—vers us with dust. A bit of it nearly hit me and uncle."</p>

					<p>More and more wounded, carried on stretchers, or walking supported by others and talking loudly, passed Prince Gáltsin.</p>
					<p>“Up they sprang, friends,” said the bass voice of a tall soldier, carrying two guns over his shoulder, “up they sprang, shouting 'Allah! Allah!'<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-43" id="noteref-43" epub:type="noteref">43</a> and just climbing one over another. You kill one, and another's there, you couldn't do anything; no end of 'em—"</p>
					<p>But at this point in the story Gáltsin interrupted him.</p>
					<p>“You are from the bastion?”</p>
					<p>“Just so, y'r honour!”</p>
					<p>“Well, what happened, tell me?"</p>
					<p>“What happened? Well, y'r honour, such a force of 'em poured down on us over the rampart, it was all up. They quite overpowered us, y'r honour!”</p>
					<p>"Overpowered?... but you repulsed them?”</p>
					<p>“How's one to repulse 'em, when <em>his</em> whole force came on, killed all our men, and no re'forcements are given?"</p>
					<p>The soldier was mistaken, the trench remained ours; but it is a curious fact, which any one may notice, that a soldier wounded in action always thinks the affair lost, and imagines it to have been a very bloody fight.</p>
					<p>“How is that? I was told they had been repulsed,” said Gáltsin irritably. “Perhaps they were driven back after you left? Is it long since you came away?"</p>
					<p>“I am straight from there, y'r honour!” answered the soldier; “it is hardly possible; they must have kept the trench, <em>he</em> overpowered us quite."</p>
					<p>“How are you not ashamed to have lost the trench? It's awful!” said Gáltsin, provoked at such indifference.</p>
					<p>"What if <em>he</em>'d the force?” muttered the soldier.</p>
					<p>“Ah, y'r honour," began a soldier from a stretcher which had just come up to them, “how could we help giving it up when <em>he</em> had killed almost all our men? If we had the force we wouldn't have given it up, not for nothing. But as it was what could one do? I stuck one, and then something hits me. Oh, oh—h! steady, lads, steady! Oh, oh!” groaned the wounded man.</p>
					<p>“Really, there seem too many men returning,” said Gáltsin, again stopping the same tall soldier with the two guns. "Why are you retiring? You there, stop!”</p>
					<p>The soldier stopped, and took off his cap with his left hand.</p>
					<p>“Where are you going, and why?" shouted Gáltsin severely; "you scoun—"</p>
					<p>But having come close up to the soldier, Gáltsin noticed that no hand was visible beneath the soldier's right cuff, and that the sleeve was soaked in blood to the elbow.</p>
					<p>“I am wounded, y'r honour.”</p>
					<p>“Wounded? How?”</p>
					<p>“Here—must ’a’ been with a bullet,” said the man, pointing to his arm, “but I don't know what struck my head here,” and bending his head, he showed the matted hair at the back stuck together with blood.</p>
					<p>“And whose is this other gun?”</p>
					<p>“It's a French rifle I took, y'r honour! But I'd not have come away if it weren't to lead this fellow—he may fall,” he added, pointing to a soldier who was walking a little in front, leaning on his gun, and painfully dragging his left leg.</p>
					<p>Prince Gáltsin suddenly felt horribly ashamed of his unjust suspicions. He felt himself blushing, turned away and, neither questioning nor watching the wounded men any more, he went to the hospital.</p>
					<p>Having pushed his way with difficulty through the porch among the wounded who had come on foot and the bearers who were carrying in the wounded and bringing out the dead, Gáltsin entered the first room, gave a look round, and involuntarily turned back and ran out into the street: it was too terrible!</p>

					<p>The large, lofty, dark hall, lit only by the four or five candles with which the doctors examined the wounded, was literally filled. The bearers kept bringing in fresh men, laying them side by side on the floor (which was already so crowded that the unfortunates jostled one another and were soaked with each other's blood), and going to fetch more wounded. The pools of blood visible in the unoccupied spaces, the feverish breathing of several hundred men, and the perspiration of the workmen with the stretchers, filled the air with a peculiar, heavy, thick, fetid mist, in which, in different parts of the hall, the candles burnt dimly. The sound of all sorts of groans, sighs, death-rattles, now and then interrupted by shrill screams, filled the whole room. Sisters, with quiet faces, expressing not an empty, feminine, painfully tearful pity, but active, practical sympathy, here and there among the bloody coats and shirts stepped across the wounded with medicines, water, bandages, and lint. The doctors, with sleeves turned up, kneeling beside the wounded—near whom the assistants held the candles—examined, felt, and probed their wounds, not heeding the terrible groans and the prayers of the sufferers. One doctor sat at a table near the door, and at the moment Gáltsin came in was already entering <abbr>No.</abbr> 532.</p>
					<p>“Iván Bogáef, Private, Company III., S⁠⸺ Regiment, <i xml:lang="la">fractura femuris complicata!</i>” shouted another doctor from the end of the room, examining a shattered leg.</p>
					<p>“Turn him over.”</p>
					<p>“Oh, oh, fathers! Oh, you're our fathers!” screamed the soldier, beseeching them not to touch him.</p>
					<p>“<i xml:lang="la">Perforatio capitis!</i>"</p>
					<p>“Simon Nefyórdof, Lieutenant-Colonel of the N⁠⸺ Infantry Regiment. Have a little patience, Colonel, or it is quite impossible; I'll have to leave you!” said a third doctor, poking about with some kind of hook in the skull of the unfortunate Colonel.</p>
					<p>“Oh, don't; oh, for God's sake be quick! be quick. Ah—!”</p>
					<p>"<i xml:lang="la">Perforatio pectoris</i>.... Sebastian Séreda, Private... what regiment? But you need not write that: <i xml:lang="la">moritur</i>. Carry him away,” said the doctor, leaving the soldier, whose eyes turned up while the death-rattle still sounded in his throat.</p>
					<p>About forty soldiers, stretcher-bearers, stood at the door waiting to carry the bandaged to the wards and the dead to the chapel. They looked on in silence, broken only now and then by a heavy sigh, at the scene before them.</p>
