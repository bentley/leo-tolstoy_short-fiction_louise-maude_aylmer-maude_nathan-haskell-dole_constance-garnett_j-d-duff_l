				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam! Only it would be a pity if it's the Doútlofs. They're all good fellows, and one of them must go if we don't send at least one of the domestic serfs," said the steward. "As it is, everyone is hinting at them.... But it's just as you please, madam!"</p>
				<p>And he placed his right hand over his left in front of him, inclined his head towards the other shoulder, drew in—almost with a smack—his thin lips, rolled up his eyes, and said no more, evidently intending to keep silent for a long time, and to listen without reply to all the absurdities his mistress was sure to utter.</p>
				<p>The steward—clean-shaven, and dressed in a long coat of a peculiar steward-like cut—who had come to report to his proprietress that autumn evening, was by origin a domestic serf.</p>
				<p>The report, from the lady's point of view, meant listening to a statement of the business done on her estate, and giving instructions for further business. From Egór Miháylovitch's (the steward's) point of view, "reporting" was a ceremony of standing straight on both feet, with turned-out toes, in a corner facing the sofa, and listening to all sorts of chatter unconnected with business, and by different ways and means getting the mistress into a state of mind in which she would quickly and impatiently say, "All right, all right!" to all that Egór Miháylovitch proposed.</p>
				<p>Recruiting was the business under consideration. The Pokróvsk estate had to supply three recruits. Two of them seemed to have been marked out by Fate itself, by a coincidence of family, moral, and economic circumstances. As far as they were concerned, there could be no hesitation or dispute either on the part of the proprietress, the Commune, or of public opinion. But who the third was to be, was a debatable point. The steward was anxious to defend the Doútlofs (in which family there were three men of an age to be recruited), and to send Polikoúshka, a married domestic serf with a very bad reputation, who had been caught more than once stealing sacks, reins, and hay; but the proprietress, who often petted Polikoúshka's ragged children, and improved his morals by exhortations from the Bible, did not wish to send him. Neither did she wish to injure the Doútlofs, whom she did not know and had never even seen. But somehow she did not seem able to grasp the fact, and the steward could not make up his mind to tell her straight out, that if Polikoúshka did not go, one of the Doútlofs would have to.</p>
				<p>"But I don't wish the Doútlofs any ill!" she said feelingly.</p>
				<p>"If you don't, then pay three hundred roubles for a substitute," should have been the steward's reply; but that would have been bad policy.</p>
				<p>So Egór Miháylovitch took up a comfortable position, and even leaned imperceptibly against the lintel of the door, while keeping a servile expression on his face and watching the movements of the lady's lips and the flutter of the frills on her cap, and their shadow on the wall beneath a picture. But he did not consider it at all necessary to attend to the meaning of her words. The lady spoke long, and said much. A desire to yawn gave him cramp behind his ears, but he adroitly turned the spasm into a cough, and, holding his hand to his mouth, gave a croak. A little while ago I saw Lord Palmerston sitting with his hat over his face while a member of the Opposition was storming at the Ministry, and then suddenly rise, and in a three hours' speech answer his opponent point by point. I saw it and was not surprised, because I had seen the same kind of thing hundreds of times going on between Egór Miháylovitch and his mistress. At last—perhaps he was afraid of falling asleep, or thought she was letting herself go too far—changing the weight of his body from his left to his right foot, he began, as he always did, with an unctuous preface:</p>
				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam.... Only, the meeting of the Commune is at present being held in front of my office window, and we must come to some conclusion. The order says that the recruits are to be in town before the Feast of Pokróf.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a> From among the peasants the Doútlofs are being suggested, and there is no one else to suggest. And the Mír does not trouble about your interests. What does it care if it ruins the Doútlofs? Don't I know what a fight they've been having? Ever since I first had the stewardship they have been living in want. The old man's youngest nephew has scarcely had time to grow up to be a help, and now they're to be ruined again! And I, as you well know, am as careful of your property as of my own.... It's a pity, madam, whatever you're pleased to think!... After all, they're neither kith nor kin to me, and I've received nothing from them...."</p>
				<p>"Why, Egór, as if I ever thought of such a thing!" interrupted the lady, and at once suspected him of having been bribed by the Doútlofs.</p>
				<p>"... Only theirs is the best homestead in the whole of Pokróvsk. They're God-fearing, hard-working peasants. The old man has been thirty years churchwarden; he doesn't drink nor use bad language; he goes to church" (the steward well knew with what to bait the hook). "... But the principal thing that I would like to report to you is that he has only two sons; the others are nephews adopted out of charity, and so they ought to cast lots only with the two-men families. Many families have split up because of their improvidence, and their own sons have separated from them, and so they are safe now—while these will have to suffer just because of their charitableness."</p>
				<p>Here the lady could not follow at all. She did not understand what he meant by a "two-men family" nor "charitableness." She only heard sounds and observed the nankeen buttons on the steward's coat. The top one, which he probably did not button up so often, was fixed on tightly; the middle one was hanging by a thread, and ought long ago to have been sewn on. But it is a well-known fact that in a conversation, especially a business conversation, it is not at all necessary to understand what is being said to you, but only to remember what you yourself want to say. The lady acted accordingly.</p>
				<p>"How is it you won't understand, Egór Miháylovitch?" she said. "I have not the least desire that a Doútlof should go as a soldier. One would think that, knowing me as you do, you might credit me with the wish to do everything in my power to help my serfs, and that I don't desire their misfortune, and that I would sacrifice all I possess to escape from this sad necessity and to send neither Doútlof nor Polikoúshka." (I don't know whether it occurred to the steward that to escape the sad necessity there was no need to sacrifice everything—that, in fact, three hundred roubles would be sufficient; but this thought might easily have occurred to him.)</p>
				<p>"I will only say this: that I will not give up Polikoúshka on any account. When, after that affair with the clock, he confessed to me of his own accord, and cried, and gave his word to amend, I talked to him for a long time, and saw that he was touched and sincerely penitent." ("There! She's off now!" thought Egór Miháylovitch, and began examining the marmalade she had in a glass of water: was it orange or lemon? "Slightly bitter, I expect," thought he.) "That is seven months ago now, and he has not once been drunk, and has behaved splendidly. His wife tells me he is a different man. How can you wish me to punish him now that he has reformed? Besides, it would be inhuman to make a soldier of a man who has five children, and he the only man in the family.... No, you'd better not say any more about it, Egór!"</p>
				<p>And the lady took a sip out of the glass. Egór Miháylovitch watched the motion of her throat as the liquid passed down it, and then replied shortly and dryly:</p>
				<p>"Then Doútlof's decided on."</p>
				<p>The lady clasped her hands together.</p>
				<p>"How is it you don't understand? Do I wish Doútlof ill? Have I anything against him? God is my witness, I am prepared to do anything for them...." (She glanced at a picture in the corner, but recollected that it was not an icon.) "Well, never mind... that's not to the point," she thought. And again, strange to say, the idea of the three hundred roubles did not occur to her.... "Well, what can I do? What do I know about it? It's impossible for me to know. Well, then, I rely on you—you know my wishes.... Act so as to satisfy everybody and according to the law.... What's to be done? They are not the only ones: everybody has times of trouble. Only, Polikoúshka can't be sent. You must understand that it would be dreadful of me to do such a thing...."</p>
				<p>She was roused, and would have continued speaking for a long time had not one of her maidservants entered the room at that moment.</p>
				<p>"What is it, Dounyásha?"</p>
				<p>"A peasant has come to ask Egór Miháylovitch if the Meeting is to wait for him," said Dounyásha, and glanced angrily at Egór Miháylovitch. ("Oh, that steward!" she thought; "he's upset the mistress. Now she'll not let one get a wink of sleep till two in the morning!")</p>
				<p>"Well then Egór, go and do the best you can."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam." He did not say anything more about Doútlof. "And who is to go to the fruit merchant to fetch the money?"</p>
				<p>"Has not Peter returned from town?"</p>
				<p>"No, madam."</p>
				<p>"Could not Nicholas go?"</p>
				<p>"Father is down with backache," remarked Dounyásha.</p>
				<p>"Should I go myself to-morrow, madam?" asked the steward.</p>
				<p>"No, Egór; you are wanted here." The lady pondered. "How much is it?"</p>
				<p>"Four hundred and sixty-two silver roubles."</p>
				<p>"Send Polikoúshka," said the lady, with a determined glance at Egór Miháylovitch's face.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch stretched his lips into the semblance of a smile, but without unclosing his teeth, and the expression of his face did not change.</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam."</p>
				<p>"Send him to me."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam;" and Egór Miháylovitch went to his office.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>
				<p>Polikéy (or Polikoúshka, as he was usually contemptuously called), as a man of little importance, of tarnished reputation, and not a native of the village, had no influence either with the housekeeper, the butler, the steward, or the lady's-maid. His cubicle was the very worst, though his family consisted of seven persons. The late proprietor had had these cubicles built in the following manner:</p>
				<p>In the middle of a brick building, about twenty-three feet square, was placed a large brick baking-oven, partly surrounded by a passage, and the four corners of the building were separated from the "collidor" (as the domestic serfs called it) by wooden stable-partitions. So there was not much room in these cubicles, especially in Polikéy's, which was nearest to the door. The family bed, with a quilt and pillow-cases made of print, the baby's cradle, and the three-legged table (on which the cooking and washing were done and all sorts of domestic articles placed, and at which Polikéy—who was a farrier—worked), tubs, clothing, some chickens, a calf, and the seven members of the family, filled the whole cubicle, and could not have moved in it had it not been for their quarter of the brick oven (on which both people and things could lie) and for the possibility of going outside into the porch. That was, perhaps, not easy, for it is rather cold in October, and the seven of them only possessed one sheepskin cloak between them; but, on the other hand, the children could keep warm by running about, and the grown-ups by working, and both the one and the other by climbing on to the top of the oven, where the temperature rose to 120 degrees. It may seem dreadful to live in such conditions, but they did not mind—it was quite possible to live. Akoulína washed and sewed her husband's and her children's clothes, spun, wove and bleached her linen, cooked and baked in the common oven, and quarrelled and gossiped with her neighbours. The monthly allowance of meal sufficed not only for the children, but to add to the cow's food. The firewood was free, and so was food for the cattle, and a little hay from the stables sometimes came their way. They had a strip of kitchen garden. Their cow had calved, and they had their own fowls. Polikéy was employed in the stables to look after two stallions; he bled horses and cattle, cleaned their hoofs, operated on them for lampers, dispensed ointments of his own invention, and for this was paid in money and in kind. Also some of the proprietress's oats used to remain over, for two measures of which a peasant in the village gave twenty pounds of mutton regularly every month. Life would have been quite tolerable, wad there been no worry. But the family had a great grief. Polikéy in his youth had lived at a stud-farm in another village. The stud-groom into whose hands he happened to fall was the greatest thief in the neighbourhood, and got exiled to Siberia. Under this man Polikéy served his apprenticeship, and in his youth got so used to those tricks that in later life, though he would willingly have left them off, he could not get out of the habit. He was a young man, and weak; he had neither father nor mother nor anyone else to teach him. Polikéy liked drink, and did not like to see anything lying about. Whether it was a strap, a piece of harness, a padlock, a bolt, or a thing of greater value, Polikéy found some use for everything. There were people everywhere who accepted these things, and paid for them in drink or in money. Such earnings, so people say, are the easiest to get: no apprenticeship required, no labour nor anything, and he who has once tried that kind of work does not desire any other. It has only one drawback: although you get things cheap and easily, and live pleasantly, yet all of a sudden—through somebody's malice—things go all wrong, the trade fails, everything has to be accounted for at once, and you rue the day you were born.</p>
				<p>And so it happened to Polikéy.</p>
				<p>Polikéy married, and God gave him joy. His wife, the daughter of a herdsman, turned out to be a healthy, intelligent, hard-working woman, who bore him one fine baby after another. And though Polikéy did not give up his trade, all went well till one fine day his luck forsook him and he was caught. And it was all about a trifle: he stole some reins from a peasant. He was found out, beaten, the proprietress was told of it; and he was watched. He was caught a second and a third time. People began to taunt him, the steward threatened to make him go as a soldier, the proprietress gave him a scolding, and his wife wept and was broken-hearted. Everything went wrong. He was a kind-hearted man; not wicked, but only weak; liking drink, and so in the habit of it that he could not leave it off. Sometimes his wife would row at him and even beat him when he came home drunk, and he would cry, saying: "Unfortunate man that I am, what shall I do? Blast my eyes, I'll leave it off! Never again!" A month goes by, and he leaves home, gets drunk, and is not seen again for a couple of days. And his neighbours say: "He must get the money somewhere to go on the spree with!"</p>
				<p>His latest trouble had been about the office clock. There was an old clock there that had not been in working order for a long time. He happened to go in at the open door all alone, and the clock tempted him. He took it and got rid of it in the town. As ill-luck would have it, the shopman to whom he sold the clock was related to one of the domestic serfs; and coming to see her one holiday, spoke about the clock. They—especially the steward, who disliked Polikéy—began making inquiries, just as if it was anybody else's concern! It was all found out and reported to the proprietress, and she sent for him. He at once fell at her feet and pathetically confessed everything, just as his wife had told him to do. He carried out his instructions very well. The proprietress began admonishing him; she talked and talked, and maundered on about God and virtue and a future life, and about wife and children, and at last drove him to tears. She said:</p>
				<p>"I forgive you; only you must promise never to do it again!"</p>
				<p>"Never in all my life. May I go to perdition! May my bowels gush out!" said Polikéy, and wept touchingly.</p>
				<p>Polikéy went home, and for the rest of the day lay on the oven, blubbering like a calf. Since then nothing more had ever been traced to him. Only his life was no longer pleasant; he was looked upon as a thief, and when the time for conscripting drew near, everybody hinted at him.</p>
				<p>Polikéy was a farrier, as already mentioned. How he became one nobody knew, he himself least of all. At the stud-farm, when he worked under the head-groom who got exiled, his only duties were to clean the stables, sometimes to groom the horses, and to carry water. So he could not have learned his trade there. Then he became a weaver; after that he worked in a garden, weeding the paths; then he was condemned to break bricks for some offence; then he went into service with a merchant, paying a yearly fine to his proprietress for permission to do so. So evidently he could not have had any experience as a veterinary; yet somehow during his last stay at home, his reputation as a wonderfully and even a rather supernaturally clever farrier began gradually to spread. He bled a horse once or twice; then threw one down and prodded about in its thigh, and then demanded that it should be placed in a stall, where he began cutting its frog till it bled. Though the horse struggled, and even squealed, he said this meant "letting out the sub-hoof blood"! Then he explained to a peasant that it was absolutely necessary to let the blood from both veins, "for greater lightness," and began hammering in the blunt lancet with a mallet; then he bandaged the innkeeper's horse under its belly with the selvedge torn from his wife's shawl, and at last he began to sprinkle all sorts of sores with vitriol, to drench them with something out of a bottle, and sometimes to give internally whatever came into his head. And the more horses he tormented and killed, the more he was believed in, and the more of them were brought to him.</p>
				<p>I feel that for us educated people it would hardly be proper to laugh at Polikéy. The methods he employed are the same that have influenced our fathers, that influence us, and will influence our children. The peasant lying prone on the head of his one mare (which not only constitutes the whole of his wealth, but is almost one of his family) and gazing with faith and horror at Polikéy's frowning look of importance and thin arms with upturned sleeves, as, with the healing rag or a bottle of vitriol between his teeth, the latter presses the sore place and boldly cuts into the living flesh (with the secret thought, "The one-eyed brute will never get over it!") and at the same time pretending to know where there is blood and where matter, which is a tendon and which a vein—that peasant cannot conceive that Polikéy has lifted his hand to cut, without due knowledge. He himself could not have done it. And once the thing is done, he will not reproach himself with having given permission to cut unnecessarily. I don't know about you, but I have experienced just the same with the doctor, who in obedience to my request was tormenting those dear to me. The lancet, the whitish bottle of sublimate, and the words, "the staggers—glanders—to let blood or matter," etc., do they not come to the same thing as "nerves, rheumatism, organism," etc.? <i xml:lang="de">Wage du zu irren und zu träume</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-206" id="noteref-206" epub:type="noteref">206</a> does not refer to poets so much as to doctors and veterinary surgeons.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
				<p>On the evening when the village Meeting, in the cold darkness of an October night, was choosing the recruits and vociferating in front of the office, Polikéy sat on the edge of his bed, rubbing down some horse medicine upon the table with a bottle; but what it was, he himself did not know. He had there sublimate of mercury, sulphur, Glauber's salts, and some kind of herb which he had gathered, having once imagined it to be good for broken wind, and now considered not useless in other disorders. The children had already gone to bed—two on the oven, two on the bed, and one in the cradle beside which Akoulína sat spinning. The remainder of a candle—one of the proprietress's candles which had not been put away carefully enough—was burning in a wooden candlestick on the window-sill, and Akoulína every now and then got up to snuff it with her fingers, so that her husband should not have to break off his important occupation. There existed independent thinkers who regarded Polikéy as a worthless farrier and a worthless man. Others, the majority, considered him a bad man, but a great master of his art; but Akoulína, though she often scolded and even beat her husband, thought him the first among farriers and the first among men. Polikéy sprinkled some kind of specific on to the palm of his hand (he never used a balance, and spoke ironically about the Germans who use balances: "This is not a pharmacy," he used to say). Polikéy weighed the specific in his hand and tossed it up, but there did not seem enough of it, and he poured in ten times as much. "I'll put in the lot," he said to himself. "It will pick 'em up better."</p>
				<p>Akoulína quickly turned round at the sound of the autocrat's voice, expecting some order; but, seeing that the business did not concern her, shrugged her shoulders.</p>
				<p>"What knowledge!... Where does he get it?" she thought, and went on spinning. The paper which had held the specific fell to the floor. Akoulína did not let this pass unnoticed.</p>
				<p>"Annie," she cried, "look! Father has dropped something. Pick it up!"</p>
				<p>Annie put out her thin little bare legs from under the cloak with which she was covered, slid down under the table like a kitten, and got the paper.</p>
				<p>"Here, daddy," she said, and with her little chilled feet darted back into bed.</p>
				<p>"Don't puth!" squeaked her lisping younger sister sleepily.</p>
				<p>"I'll give it you!" muttered Akoulína; and both heads disappeared again under the cloak.</p>
				<p>"He'll give me three roubles," said Polikéy, corking up the bottle. "I'll cure the horse. It's even too cheap," he added, "brain-splitting work!... Akoulína, go and ask Nikíta for a little 'baccy. I'll return it to-morrow;" and Polikéy took out of his trouser-pocket a limewood pipe-stem which had once been painted, with a mouthpiece of sealing-wax, and began fixing it on to the bowl.</p>
				<p>Akoulína left her spindle and went out, managing to steer clear of everything—though this was not easy. Polikéy opened the cupboard and put away the medicine, then tilted a vódka bottle into his mouth, but it was empty, and he made a grimace; but when his wife brought the tobacco he sat down on the edge of the bed after filling and lighting his pipe, and his face shone with the content and pride of a man who has completed his day's task. Whether he was thinking how on the morrow he would catch hold of a horse's tongue and pour his wonderful mixture down its throat, or considering the fact that a useful person never gets a refusal—"There, now! Hadn't Nikíta sent him some tobacco?"—anyhow, he felt happy.</p>
				<p>Suddenly the door, hanging on one hinge, was thrown open, and a maidservant from <em>up there</em>—not the second maid, but the third, the little one that was kept to run errands—entered the cubicle. (<em>Up there</em>, as everyone knows, means the proprietor's house, even if it is situated lower down.) Aksyúta—that was the girl's name—always flew like a bullet, and did it without bending her arms, which, keeping time with the speed of her flight, swung like pendulums, not by her sides, but in front of her. Her cheeks were always redder than her pink dress, and her tongue moved as rapidly as her legs. She flew into the room, and for some reason catching hold of the stove, began to sway to and fro; then, as if reluctant on any account to bring out more than two or three words at a time, she all of a sudden breathlessly addressed Akoulína as follows:</p>
				<p>"The mistress... has given orders... that Polikoúshka should come this minute... orders to come up...."</p>
				<p>She stopped, breathing heavily.</p>
				<p>"Egór Miháylovitch has been with the mistress... they talked about <em>rickruits</em>... they mentioned Polikoúshka... Avdótya Nikoláyevna... has ordered you to come this minute... Avdótya Nikoláyevna has ordered..." again a sigh," to come this minute...."</p>
				<p>For half a minute Aksyúta looked round at Polikéy and at Akoulína and the children—who had put out their heads from under their bed-clothes—picked up a nutshell that lay on the stove, and threw it at little Annie. Then she repeated:</p>
				<p>"To come this minute!..." and rushed out of the room like a whirlwind, the pendulums swinging as usual at right angles to the line of her flight.</p>
				<p>Akoulína again rose, and got her husband's boots—abominable soldier's boots, with holes in them—and got down his coat and passed it to him without speaking.</p>
				<p>"Won't you change your shirt, Polikéy?"</p>
				<p>"No," he answered.</p>
				<p>Akoulína never once looked at his face while he put on his boots and coat, and she did well not to look. Polikéy's face was pale, his nether jaw trembled, and in his eyes there was that tearful, submissive and deeply mournful look one only sees in the eyes of kindly, weak, and guilty people.</p>
				<p>He combed his hair, and was going out; but his wife stopped him, hid the string of his shirt that hung down from under his coat, and put his cap on for him.</p>
				<p>"What's that, Polikoúshka? Has the mistress sent for you?" came the voice of the carpenter's wife from behind the partition.</p>
				<p>Only that morning the carpenter's wife had had high words with Akoulína about her pot of potash<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-207" id="noteref-207" epub:type="noteref">207</a> that Polikéy's children had upset, and at first she was pleased to hear Polikéy being summoned to the mistress: most likely for no good. She was a cute, diplomatic lady, with a biting tongue. Nobody knew better than she how to pay anyone out with a word: so she imagined.</p>
				<p>"I expect you'll be sent to town to do the shopping," she continued. "I suppose a safe person must be chosen to do that job, so you'll be sent! Please buy a quarter of a pound of tea for me there, Polikéy."</p>
				<p>Akoulína forced back her tears, and an angry expression distorted her lips. She felt as if she could have clutched "that vixen the joiner's wife, by her mangy hair." But when she looked at her children, and thought that they would be left fatherless and she herself a soldier's wife and as good as widowed, she forgot the sharp-tongued joiner's wife, hid her face in her hands, sat down on the bed, and let her head sink in the pillows.</p>
				<p>"Mammy, you cluth me!" lisped her little girl, pulling the cloak with which she was covered from under her mother's elbow.</p>
				<p>"If you'd only die, all of you! I've brought you into the world for nothing but sorrow!" exclaimed Akoulína, and sobbed aloud, to the joy of the joiner's wife, who had not yet forgotten the potash.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="polikoushka-4" epub:type="chapter">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>
				<p>Half an hour passed. The baby began to cry. Akoulína rose and gave it the breast. Weeping no longer, but resting her thin, though still handsome, face on her hand, and fixing her eyes on the last flickerings of the candle, she sat thinking why she had married, wondering why so many soldiers were needed, and also how she could pay out the joiner's wife.</p>
				<p>She heard her husband's footsteps; and, wiping her tears, got up to let him pass. Polikéy entered like a conqueror, threw his cap on the bed, puffed, and unfastened his belt.</p>
				<p>"Well, what did she want?"</p>
				<p>"H'm! Of course! Polikoúshka is the least among men... but when there's business to be done, who's wanted? Why, Polikoúshka...."</p>
				<p>"What business?"</p>
				<p>Polikéy did not hasten to reply. He lit his pipe and spat.</p>
				<p>"To go and get money from a tradesman."</p>
				<p>"To fetch money?" Akoulína asked.</p>
				<p>Polikéy chuckled and wagged his head.</p>
				<p>"Ah! Ain't she clever at words?... 'You have been regarded,' she says, ' as an untrustworthy man; but I trust you more than another'" (Polikéy spoke in a loud voice that the neighbours might hear). "'You promised me you'd reform; here,' she says, 'is the first proof that I believe you. Go,' she says, 'to the customer, fetch the money he owes, and bring it back to me.' And I say: 'We all are your serfs, ma'am,' I say, 'and I must serve you as we serve the Lord; therefore I feel myself that I can do anything for Your Honour, and cannot refuse any kind of job; whatever you order I will fulfil, because I am your slave.'" (He again smiled that peculiar weak, kindly, guilty smile.) "'Well, then,' she says, 'you will do it faithfully?... You understand,' she says, 'that your fate depends on it?'—'How could I help understanding that I can do something? If they have told tales about me—well, anyone can tell tales about anybody... but I never in any way, I believe, have even had a thought against Your Honour...' In a word, I buttered her up till my lady was quite softened.... 'I shall think highly of you,' she says." (He kept silent a minute, then the smile again appeared on his face.) "I know very well how to talk to the likes of them! Formerly, when I used to pay for the right to work on my own, one of them would come down hard on me; but only let me say a word or two... I'd butter him up till he'd be as smooth as silk!"</p>
				<p>"Is it much?"</p>
				<p>"Three half-thousands of roubles," carelessly replied Polikéy.</p>
				<p>She shook her head.</p>
				<p>"When are you to go?"</p>
				<p>"'To-morrow,' she says. 'Take any horse you like,' she says, 'call at the office, and then start, in Heaven's name!'"</p>
				<p>"Glory to the Lord!" said Akoulína, rising and crossing herself.</p>
				<p>"May God help you, Polikéy," she added in a whisper, so that she should not be heard behind the partition, holding him by his shirt-sleeve. "Polikéy, listen to me! I beseech you in the name of Christ our God: when you start, kiss the cross and promise that not a drop shall pass your lips."</p>
				<p>"A likely thing!" he ejaculated; "drink when carrying all that money!... Ah! how somebody was playing the piano up there! Fine!..." he said, after a pause, and smiled. "I suppose it's the young lady. I was standing like this, in front of the mistress, beside the what-not, and the young lady was careering away behind the door. She rattled, rattled on, fitting it together so pat! Oh my! Wouldn't I like to play a tune! I'd soon master it, I would. I'm awfully good at that sort of thing.... Get me a clean shirt, do, to-morrow!"</p>
				<p>And they went to bed happy.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>
				<p>Meanwhile the Meeting had been vociferating in front of the office. The business before them was not a trifling one. Almost all the peasants were present. While the steward was with the proprietress they put on their caps, more voices joined in, and they talked more loudly. The hum of the deep voices, at rare intervals interrupted by breathless hoarse and shrill tones, filled the air, and entering through the windows of the proprietress's house sounded like the noise of the distant sea, making her feel a nervous agitation resembling that produced by a heavy thunderstorm—a sensation between fear and discomfort. She felt as if the voices might at any moment grow yet louder and faster, and then something would happen.</p>
				<p>"As if it could not all be done quietly, peaceably, without disputing and shouting," she thought, "according to the Christian law of brotherly love and meekness!"</p>
				<p>Many voices were speaking at once, but Theodore Resoún, a carpenter, shouted loudest. There were two grown-up young men in his family, and he was attacking the Doútlofs. Old Doútlof was defending himself: he had stepped forward out of the crowd behind which he had at first stood. Now spreading out his arms, now clutching at his little beard, he sputtered and snuffled in such a manner that it would have been hard for himself to understand what he was saying. His sons and nephews—splendid fellows, all of them—stood pressing behind him, and the old man resembled the mother-hen in the game of hawk-and-chickens. The hawk was Resoún; and not only Resoún, but all the men who had two grown lads in their family, were attacking Doútlof. The point was, that Doútlof's brother had been recruited thirty years before, and that Doútlof wished to be excused therefore from taking his turn with the families in which there were three grown-up young men, and wanted his brother's service in the army to be counted to the advantage of his family, so that it should be given the same chance as those in which there were only two young men; and that these should all draw lots equally, and the third recruit be chosen from among all of them. Besides Doútlof's family, there were four others in which there were three young men, but one was the village elder's family, and the proprietress had exempted him. From the second, a recruit had been taken the year before, and from the remaining families two recruits were now being taken. One of them had not even come to this Meeting, only his wife stood sorrowfully behind all the others, vaguely expecting that the wheel of fortune might somehow turn her way. The red-haired Román, the father of the other recruit, in a tattered coat—though he was not poor—hung his head and silently leant against the porch railing, only now and then attentively looking up at anybody who raised his voice, and then hanging his head again. Misery seemed to breathe from his whole figure. Old Simeon Doútlof was a man to whose keeping anyone who knew him would have trusted hundreds and thousands of roubles. He was a steady, God-fearing, well-to-do man, and was churchwarden. Therefore the predicament in which he found himself was all the more startling.</p>
				<p>Resoún the carpenter was a tall, dark man, a riotous drunkard, very smart in a dispute and in arguing with workmen, tradespeople, peasants, and gentlefolk at meetings and fairs. He was quiet now and sarcastic, and from his superior height he was crushing down the spluttering churchwarden with the whole strength of his ringing voice and oratorical talent. The churchwarden was exasperated out of his usual sober groove. Besides these, the youngish, round-faced, square-headed, curly-bearded, thick-set Garáska Kopýlof, one of the talkers of the younger generation, was taking part in the dispute. He came next to Resoún in importance. He had already gained some weight at the Meetings, having distinguished himself by his trenchant speeches. Then there was Theodore Mélnitchny, a tall, thin, yellow-faced, round-shouldered man, still young, with a thin beard and small eyes, always embittered and gloomy, seeing the dark side of everything, and often puzzling the Meeting by his unexpected and abrupt questions and remarks. Both these speakers sided with Resoún. Besides these, now and then two chatterers joined in: one with a most good-humoured face and flowing brown beard, called Hrapkóf, who kept repeating the words, "Oh, my dearest friend!" the other, Zhidkóf, a little fellow with a bird-like face, who also kept remarking at every opportunity, "That's how it is, brothers mine!" addressing himself to everybody and speaking fluently, but without rhyme or reason. They both sided first with one and then with the other party, but no one listened to them. There were others like them, but these two, who kept moving through the crowd and shouting louder than anybody and frightening the proprietress, were listened to less than anyone else, and, intoxicated by the noise and shouting, gave themselves up entirely to the pleasure of wagging their tongues.</p>
				<p>There were many other characters among the members of the Commune, stern, respectable, indifferent, dismal, or down-trodden; and there were women standing behind the men, but, God willing, I'll speak of them some other time. The greater part of the crowd, however, consisted of peasants who stood as if they were in church, whispering behind each other's backs about home affairs, about how best to mark the trees in the forest, or silently hoping that the jabbering would soon cease. There were also rich peasants, whose well-being the Meeting could not add to nor diminish. Such was Ermíl, with his broad, shiny face, whom the peasants called the "full-bellied," because he was rich. Such too was Stárostin, whose face seemed to say, "You may talk away, but no one will touch me! I have four sons, but not one of them will have to go." Now and then these two were attacked by some independent thinker such as Kopýlof or Resoún, but they replied quietly and firmly, and with a sense of their own immunity. If Doútlof was like the mother-hen in the game of hawk-and-chickens, his lads did not much resemble the chicks. They did not flutter about and squeak, but stood quietly behind him. His eldest son, Ignát, was already thirty; the second, too, was already a married man, and, moreover, not fit for service; the third was his nephew Elijah, who had just got married—a fair, rosy young man in a smart sheepskin coat (he was post-horse driver). He stood looking at the crowd, sometimes scratching his head under his hat, as if the whole matter was no concern of his, though it was just him that the hawks wished to swoop down on.</p>
				<p>"Why, my grandfather was a soldier," said one, "and so I might in just the same way refuse to draw lots!... There's no such law, friend. Last recruiting, Mihéyevitch was enlisted, and his uncle had then not even returned from service."</p>
				<p>"Neither your father nor any uncle of yours has served the Tsar," Doútlof was saying at the same time." Why, you have not even served the proprietress or the Commune, but spend all your time in the pub. Your sons have separated from you because it's impossible to live with you, so you go suggesting other people's sons for recruits! And I have done police duty for ten years and been churchwarden. Twice I have suffered from fires, and no one helped me over it; and now, because things go on peaceably and honourably in my homestead, am I to be ruined?... Give me my brother back, then! I dare say he has died in service.... Judge righteously, according to God's will, Christian Commune, and don't listen to a drunkard's drivel."</p>
				<p>And at the same time Gerásim was saying to Doútlof:</p>
				<p>"You are using your brother as an excuse, but he was not enlisted by the Commune. He was sent by the proprietor because of his evil ways, so he is no excuse for you."</p>
				<p>Gerásim had not finished when the long, yellow-faced Theodore Mélnitchny stepped forward and began dismally:</p>
				<p>"Yes, that's the way! The proprietors send whom they list, and then the Commune has got to get the muddle straight. The Commune has chosen your lad, and if you don't like it, go and ask the lady. Perhaps she will order me, the one man of the family, to leave my children and go!... There's law for you!" he said bitterly, and, waving his hand, he returned to his former place.</p>
				<p>The red-haired Román, whose son had been chosen as a recruit, raised his head and muttered: "That's it, that's it!" and even sat down on the step in vexation.</p>
				<p>But these were not the only ones who were speaking all at once. Besides those behind, who were talking about their own affairs, the chatterers did not neglect their part.</p>
				<p>"And so it is, faithful Commune," said the little Zhidkóf, repeating Doútlof's words. "One must judge in a Christian manner.... In a Christian way, I mean, brothers, we must judge."</p>
				<p>"One must judge according to one's conscience, my dear friend," spoke the good-humoured Hrapkóf, repeating Kopýlof's words, and pulling Doútlof by his sheepskin.</p>
				<p>"That was the proprietor's will, and not the decision of the Commune."</p>
				<p>"That's right! That's what it is," said others.</p>
				<p>"What drunkard is drivelling?" Resoún retorted to Doútlof. "Did you stand me any drinks? Or is your son, whom they pick up by the roadside, going to reproach me with drink?... Friends, we must decide! If you want to spare Doútlof, choose not only out of families with two men, but even the one man of a family, and he will have the laugh of us!"</p>
				<p>"Doútlof's will have to go! What's the good of talking?"</p>
				<p>"It's evident the three-men families must be the first to draw lots," began different voices.</p>
				<p>"We must first see what the proprietress will say. Egór Miháylovitch was saying that they wanted to send a domestic serf," put in a voice.</p>
				<p>This remark stopped the dispute for a while, but soon it flared up anew, and again came down to personalities.</p>
				<p>Ignát, whom Resoún had accused of being picked up drunk by the roadside, began to make out that Resoún had stolen a saw from some passing carpenter, and that, when drunk, he had nearly beaten his wife to death.</p>
				<p>Resoún replied that he beat his wife, drunk or sober, and still it was not enough; and this set everybody laughing. But about the saw he became suddenly indignant, stepped closer to Ignát and asked:</p>
				<p>"Who stole?..."</p>
				<p>"You did," replied the sturdy Ignát, drawing still closer.</p>
				<p>"Who stole?... Was it not yourself?" shouted Resoún.</p>
				<p>"No, it was you," said Ignát.</p>
				<p>From the saw they went on to a stolen horse, a bag of oats, some strip of kitchen-garden, a dead body; and the two peasants said such terrible things to one another, that if a one-hundredth part of them had been true they would at the very least have legally deserved exile to Siberia.</p>
				<p>In the meantime old Doútlof had chosen another way of defending himself. He did not like his son's shouting, and tried to stop him, saying: "It's a sin.... Leave off, I tell you!"</p>
				<p>At the same time he argued that not only those who had three young men at home were three-men families, but also those whose sons had separated from them.</p>
				<p>Stárostin smiled slightly, cleared his throat, and, stroking his beard with the air of a rich man, answered that it all depended on the proprietress, and that evidently his sons had deserved well, since the order was for them to be exempt.</p>
				<p>Gerásim answered Doútlof's arguments with respect to the families that had broken up, by the remark that they ought not to have been allowed to break up, as was the rule during the lifetime of the late proprietor; that it was no use crying over spilt milk; and that, after all, one could not enlist the only man left in a household.</p>
				<p>"Did they break up their households for fun? Why should they now be completely ruined?" came the voices of the men whose families had separated; and the chatterers joined in, too.</p>
				<p>"You'd better buy a substitute, if you're not satisfied. You can afford it!" said Resoún to Doútlof.</p>
				<p>Doútlof wrapped his coat round him with a despairing gesture, and stepped back behind the others.</p>
				<p>"I suppose you've counted my money?" he muttered angrily. "We shall see what Egór Miháylovitch will say, when he comes from the proprietress."</p>
			</section>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VI</h3>
				<p>At that very moment Egór Miháylovitch came out of the house. One cap after another was lifted, and as the steward approached, all the heads—white, grey, red, brown, fair, or bald in front or on top—were uncovered, and the voices were gradually silenced, till at last all was quiet.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch stepped on to the porch, evidently intending to speak. In his long coat, his hands stuffed awkwardly into the pockets, his cap pulled over his forehead, he stood firmly, his feet apart, on this elevated place, lording it over all these heads—mostly old, bearded and handsome—that were turned towards him. He was now a different man from what he had been when he stood before his mistress. He was majestic.</p>
				<p>"This is the mistress's decision, lads! It is not her wish to give up any of the domestic serfs; but from among you, those whom you yourselves decide on, they shall go. Three are wanted this time. By rights only two and a half are wanted, but the half will be taken into account next time. It comes to the same thing: if it were not to-day, it would have to be to-morrow."</p>
				<p>"Of course, that's quite right!" some voices said.</p>
				<p>"In my opinion," continued Egór Miháylovitch, "Harúshkin and Váska Mitúhin must go; that is evidently God's will."</p>
				<p>"Yes, that's quite right!" said the voices.</p>
				<p>"... The third will have to be one of the Doútlofs, or one out of a two-men family.... What do you say?"</p>
				<p>"Doútlof!" cried the voices. "There are three of them of the right age!"</p>
				<p>And again, slowly, slowly, the shouting increased, and somehow the question of the strip of kitchen-garden and some kind of sacks stolen from the mistress's yard came up again. Egór Miháylovitch had been managing the estate for the last twenty years, and he was a clever and experienced man. He stood and listened for about a quarter of an hour, then he ordered everybody to be quiet and the three younger Doútlofs to draw lots, to see which of the three was to go.</p>
				<p>They prepared the lots, which were shaken up in a hat, and Hrapkóf took one out. It was Elijah's. All became silent.</p>
				<p>"Is it mine? Let me see!" said Elijah in a faltering voice.</p>
				<p>All remained silent. Egór Miháylovitch gave orders that everybody should bring the recruiting money—a tax of seven copecks from every household—next day, and saying that all was finished, dismissed the Meeting. The crowd moved away, the men covered their heads, and as they turned the corner their voices and the sound of their footsteps mingled into a hum. The steward stood on the porch, watching the departing crowd, and when the young Doútlofs had passed him, he beckoned the old man, who had stopped of his own accord, and they went into the office.</p>
				<p>"I am sorry for you, old man," said Egór Miháylovitch, sitting down in an arm-chair in front of the table. "Your turn has come. Won't you buy a recruit to take your nephew's place?"</p>
				<p>The old man, without speaking, gave Egór Miháylovitch a significant look.</p>
				<p>"He can't escape," said Egór Miháylovitch, in answer to that look.</p>
				<p>"We'd be glad enough to buy a substitute, but have not the means, Egór Miháylovitch. Two horses went to the knacker's this summer, and then there was my nephew's wedding.... Evidently it's our fate... for living honestly. It's very well for him to talk!" (He was thinking of Resoún.)</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch rubbed his face with his hand and yawned. He was evidently tired of the subject; besides, he was ready for his tea.</p>
				<p>"Eh, old fellow! Don't you be mean!" said he. "Have a hunt in the cellar; I dare say you'll turn up some four hundred old rouble notes, and I'll get you a substitute—a regular wonder!... The other day a fellow came offering himself."</p>
				<p>"In the <em>government</em>?" asked Doútlof, meaning the town.</p>
				<p>"Well, will you buy him?"</p>
				<p>"I'd be glad enough, God's my witness!... but..."</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch sternly interrupted him.</p>
				<p>"Well, then, listen to me, old man! See that Elijah does himself no injury, and as soon as I send word—whenever that may be—he is to be taken to town at once. You will take him, and you will be answerable for him; but if—which God forbid!—anything should happen to him, I'll send your eldest son instead! Do you hear?"</p>
				<p>"But could not one be sent from a two-man family?... Egór Miháylovitch, this is an affront!" he said. Then, after a pause, he went on, almost with tears:</p>
				<p>"It seems that my brother died a soldier, and now they are taking my boy! How have I deserved such a blow?" and he was ready to fall on his knees.</p>
				<p>"Well, well, go away!" said Egór Miháylovitch. "Nothing can be done. It's the law. Keep an eye on Elijah: you'll have to answer for him!"</p>
				<p>Doútlof went home, thoughtfully tapping the ruts with his stick as he walked.</p>

			<section id="polikoushka-7" epub:type="chapter">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VII</h3>
				<p>Early next morning a big-boned bay gelding—for some reason called Drum—harnessed to a small cart (the steward himself used to drive in that cart), stood at the porch of the serfs' quarters. Annie, Polikéy's eldest daughter, barefooted in spite of the falling sleet and the cold wind, and evidently frightened, stood holding the reins at arm's length, and with her other hand held a faded, yellowy-green jacket that was thrown over her head. This jacket served the family as blanket, cloak, hood, carpet, overcoat for Polikéy, and many other things besides. Polikéy's cubicle was all in a bustle. The dim light of a rainy morning was just peeping in at the window, which was broken here and there, and mended with paper. Akoulína went away from her cooking by the oven, and left her children—the youngest of whom were still in bed—shivering because the jacket that served them as a blanket had been taken away and only replaced by the shawl off their mother's head.</p>
				<p>Akoulína was busy getting her husband ready for his journey. His shirt was clean, but his boots, which were gaping open, gave her much trouble. She had taken off her thick worsted stockings (her only pair) and given them to her husband, and had managed to cut out a pair of soles from a saddle-cloth (that had been carelessly left about in the stable and brought home by Polikéy two days before) in such a way that they should stop the holes in his boots and keep his feet dry.</p>
				<p>Polikéy sat, feet and all on the bed, untwisting his girdle so that it should not look like a dirty rope. The lisping, cross little girl, wrapped in the sheepskin (which though it covered her head was trailing round her feet) had been despatched to ask Nikíta to lend them a cap. The bustle was increased by the other serfs, who came to ask Polikéy to get different things for them in town. One wanted needles; another, tea; a third, some tobacco; and another, some oil to burn before his icon. The joiner's wife—who to conciliate Polikéy had already had time to boil her samovár, and bring him a mug full of liquid which she called tea—wanted some sugar.</p>
				<p>Though Nikíta refused to lend a cap, and they had to mend their own—i.e., to push in the bits of wadding that hung out of the rents and to sew them up with the surgical needle; though at first the boots with the saddle-cloth soles would not go on to his feet; though Annie, chilled through, nearly let Drum get away, and Mary, in the long sheepskin, had to take her place, and then Mary had to take off the sheepskin, and Akoulína had to hold the horse herself—it all ended by Polikéy successfully getting all the warm family garments on to himself, leaving only the jacket and a pair of slippers behind. When ready, he got into the little cart. He wrapped the sheepskin coat round him, shook up the bag of hay at the bottom of the cart, again wrapped himself round, took the reins, wrapped the coat still closer round him in the way that very respectable men do, and started.</p>
				<p>His little boy Mike, running out into the porch, begged to have a ride; the lisping Mary also begged that she might "have a lide," and was "not cold even without the theepthkin;" so Polikéy stopped Drum and smiled his weak smile, while Akoulína put the children into the cart and, bending towards him, asked him in a whisper to remember his oath, and not to drink on the way.</p>
				<p>Polikéy took the children through the village as far as the smithy, put them down, wrapped himself up and put his cap straight again, and drove off at a slow, sedate trot, his cheeks shaking at every jolt and his feet knocking against the sides of the cart. Mary and Mike, with their bare feet, rushed down the slippery hill to the house at such a rate, and yelling so, that a stray dog from the village looked up at them and scurried home with its tail between its legs, which made Polikéy's heirs yell ten times louder.</p>
				<p>It was abominable weather: the wind was cutting, and something between rain and snow, and now and then fine hail, beat on Polikéy's face and on his bare hands which held the reins—and over which he kept drawing the sleeves of his coat—and on the leather of the horse-collar, and on the old head of Drum, who set back his ears and half closed his eyes.</p>
				<p>Then suddenly the rain stopped, and it brightened up for a moment. The bluish snow-clouds stood out clear, and the sun seemed to come out, but uncertainly and cheerlessly, like Polikéy's own smile. Nevertheless, Polikéy was deep in pleasant thoughts. He whom they threatened to exile and enlist, whom only those who were too lazy did not scold and beat, who was always shoved into the worst places, <em>he</em> was now driving to fetch a sum of money, and a large sum, and his mistress trusted him, and he was driving in the steward's cart behind Drum—with whom the lady herself had driven out—just as if he were some innkeeper, with leather collar-strap and reins instead of ropes. And Polikéy settled himself straighter, pushed in the bits of wadding hanging out of his cap, and again wrapped his coat closer.</p>
				<p>However, if Polikéy imagined that he looked like a wealthy peasant proprietor, he deluded himself. It is true that everyone knows that tradesmen worth ten thousand roubles drive in carts with leather harness; only this was not quite the thing. A bearded man in a blue or black coat drives past, sitting alone inside a cart, driving a well-fed horse, and you just glance to see if the horse is sleek and he himself well fed, and at the way he sits, at the horse's harness, and the tyres of the cart-wheels and at his girdle, and you know at once whether the man has a turnover of a hundred or a thousand roubles. Every experienced person looking closer at Polikéy, at his hands, his face, his newly-grown beard, his girdle, at the hay carelessly thrown into the cart, at the bony Drum, at the worn tyres, would know at once that it was only a serf driving past, and not a merchant, or a cattle-dealer, or even a peasant proprietor, and that he was not worth a thousand, or a hundred, or even ten, roubles.</p>
				<p>But Polikéy did not think so: he deceived himself, and deceived himself agreeably. Three half-thousand roubles he is going to carry home in the bosom of his coat. If he likes, he may turn Drum's head towards Odessa, instead of towards home, and drive off where Fate will take him. But he will not do such a thing; he will bring the lady her money all in order, and will talk about having had larger sums than that on him.</p>
				<p>When they came to a public-house Drum began to pull against the left rein, turning towards it and stopping; but Polikéy, though he had the money given him to do the shopping with, cracked the whip above Drum's head and drove on. The same thing happened at the next public-house, and about noon he got out of the cart, and, opening the gate of the tradesman's house where all his proprietress's people put up, led the horse and cart into the yard. There he gave the horse some hay, dined with the tradesman's men, not forgetting to say what important business he had come on, and then went out, with the fruitseller's bill in the crown of his cap.</p>
				<p>The fruitseller (who knew and evidently mistrusted Polikéy), having read the letter, questioned him as to whether he had really been sent for the money. Polikéy tried to seem offended, but could not manage it, and only smiled his peculiar smile. The fruitseller read the letter over once more, and handed him the money.</p>
				<p>Having received the money, Polikéy put it into his bosom and went back to the lodgings. Neither the beershop nor the public-house nor anything tempted him. He felt a pleasant agitation through the whole of his being, and stopped more than once in front of shops exhibiting tempting wares: boots, coats, caps, prints, and food-stuffs, and went on with the pleasant thought: "I could buy it all, but there, now, I won't do it!"</p>
				<p>He went to the market for the things he was asked to buy, collected them all, and started bargaining for a tanned sheepskin coat, for which they were asking twenty-five roubles. For some reason the dealer, after looking at Polikéy, seemed to doubt that he could buy it. But Polikéy pointed to his breast, saying that if he liked he could buy the whole shop, and asked to have the coat tried on; felt it, patted it, blew into the wool till he became permeated with the smell of it, and then took it off with a sigh.</p>
				<p>"The price does not suit me. If you'll let it go for fifteen roubles, now!" he said.</p>
				<p>The dealer angrily threw the coat across the table, and Polikéy went out and cheerfully returned to his lodgings.</p>
				<p>After supper, having watered Drum and given him some oats, he climbed up on the oven, took out the envelope with the money and examined it for a long time, and then asked a porter, who knew how to read, to read him the address and the words: "With an enclosure of one thousand six hundred and seventeen Assignation Roubles." The envelope was made of common paper, and sealed with brown sealing-wax, with an anchor stamped on it. There was one large seal in the middle, four at the corners, and there was a drop of sealing-wax near the edge. Polikéy examined all this, and learnt it by heart. He even felt the sharp corners of the paper money. It gave him a kind of childish pleasure to know that he had so much money in his hands. He inserted the money into a hole in the lining of his cap, and lay down with his head on it; but even in the night he kept waking and feeling the envelope. And each time he found it in its place he experienced the pleasant feeling that here was he, the disgraced, the down-trodden Polikéy, carrying such a sum and delivering it up so accurately, as even the steward would not have done.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VIII</h3>
				<p>About midnight the tradesman's men and Polikéy were wakened by a knocking at the gate and the shouting of peasants. It was the party of recruits from Pokróvsk. There were about ten of them: Harúshkin, Mitúshkin, and Elijah (Doútlof's nephew), two reserve recruits, the village Elder, old Doútlof, and the men who had driven them. A night-light was burning in the room, and the cook was sleeping on a bench under the icons. She jumped up and began lighting a candle. Polikéy awoke also, and, leaning over from the top of the oven, looked at the peasants as they came in. They came in crossing themselves, and sat down on the benches round the room. They all seemed perfectly calm, so that one could not tell which of them were being enlisted and who had them in charge. They were saying "How d'you do?" talking loudly, and asking for food. It is true that some were silent and sad; but, on the other hand, others were unusually merry, evidently drunk. Among these was Elijah, who had never had too much to drink before.</p>
				<p>"Well, lads, shall we go to sleep, or have some supper?" asked the Elder.</p>
				<p>"Supper!" said Elijah, throwing open his coat, and settling himself on a bench. "Send for vódka."</p>
				<p>"Enough of your vódka!" answered the Elder shortly, and turning to the others he said:</p>
				<p>"You just cut yourselves a bit of bread, lads! Why wake people up?"</p>
				<p>"Give me vódka!" Elijah repeated, without looking at anybody. "I tell you, give me some!" Then, noticing Polikéy: "Polikéy! Hi, Polikéy! You here, dear friend? Why, I am going for a soldier.... Have taken final leave of mother, of my missus.... How she howled! They've bundled me off for a soldier.... Stand me some vódka!"</p>
				<p>"I've no money," answered Polikéy, and to comfort him, added: "Who knows? By God's help you may be rejected!..."</p>
				<p>"No, friend. I'm as sound as a young birch. I've never had an illness. There's no rejecting for me! What better soldier can the Tsar want?"</p>
				<p>Polikéy began telling him how a peasant gave the doctor a five-rouble note and got rejected.</p>
				<p>Elijah drew nearer the oven, and started talking.</p>
				<p>"No, Polikéy, it's all up now! I don't wish to stay myself. Uncle has done for me. As if we could not have bought a substitute!... No, he pities his son, and grudges the money, so they send me. No! I don't want to stay myself." He spoke gently, confidingly, under the influence of quiet sorrow. "One thing only—I am sorry for mother, dear heart!... How she grieved! And the missus, too!... They've ruined the woman just for nothing; now she'll perish—in a word, she'll be a soldier's wife! Better not have married. Why did they marry me?... They'll come here to-morrow."</p>
				<p>"But why have they brought you so soon?" asked Polikéy; "nothing was heard about it, and then, all of a sudden..."</p>
				<p>"Why, they're afraid I shall do myself some injury," answered Elijah, smiling. "No fear! I'll do nothing of the kind. I shall not be lost even as a soldier; only I'm sorry for mother.... Why did they marry me?" he said gently and sadly.</p>
				<p>The door opened and banged loudly as old Doútlof came in, shaking the wet off his cap, and, as usual, in bark shoes so big that they looked like boats.</p>
				<p>"Athanasius," he said to the porter, when he had crossed himself, "isn't there a lantern, to get some oats by?"</p>
				<p>Doútlof, without looking at Elijah, began slowly lighting a bit of candle. His gloves and whip were stuck into the girdle tied neatly round his coat, and his toil-worn face appeared as ordinary, simple, quiet, and full of business cares as if he had just arrived with a train of loaded carts.</p>
				<p>Elijah became silent when he saw his uncle, and looked dismally down at the bench again. Then, addressing the Elder, he muttered:</p>
				<p>"Vódka, Ermíl! I want some drink!" His voice sounded vindictive and dejected.</p>
				<p>"Drink, at this time?" answered the Elder, who was eating something out of a bowl. "Don't you see the others have had a bite and gone to lie down? Why do you kick up a row?"</p>
				<p>The word "row" evidently suggested to Elijah the idea of violence.</p>
				<p>"Elder, I'll do some mischief if you don't give me vódka!"</p>
				<p>"Couldn't you bring him to reason?" the Elder said, turning to Doútlof, who had lit the lantern and stopped, apparently to see what would happen, and was looking pityingly at his nephew out of the corners of his eyes, as if surprised at his childishness.</p>
				<p>Elijah, taken aback, again muttered:</p>
				<p>"Vódka! Give... do mischief!"</p>
				<p>"Leave off, Elijah!" said the Elder gently. "Really, now, leave off! You'd better!"</p>
				<p>But before the words were out, Elijah had jumped up and hit a window-pane with his fist, and shouting at the top of his voice: "You won't hear me! So there you are!" rushed to the other window to break that also.</p>
				<p>Polikéy, in the twinkling of an eye, rolled twice over and hid in the farthest corner of the top of the oven, so quickly that he scared all the cockroaches there. The Elder threw down his spoon and rushed toward Elijah. Doútlof untied his girdle, and shaking his head and making a clicking noise with his tongue, approached Elijah, who was already struggling with the Elder and the porter, who were keeping him away from the window. They had caught his arms and seemed to be holding him fast; but as soon as he saw his uncle and the girdle, his strength increased tenfold and he tore himself away, and with rolling eyes and clenched fists stepped up to Doútlof.</p>
				<p>"I'll kill you! Keep away, barbarian!... You have ruined me, you and your brigands of sons, you've ruined me!... Why did they marry me?... Keep away! I'll kill you!..."</p>
				<p>Elijah was terrible. His face was purple, his eyes rolled, the whole of his young, healthy body trembled as in a fever. He seemed to wish and to be able to kill all the three men who were facing him.</p>
				<p>"You're drinking your brother's blood, you blood-sucker!"</p>
				<p>Something flashed across Doútlof's ever-placid face. He took a step forward.</p>
				<p>"You won't take it peaceably!" said he suddenly. The wonder was, where he got the energy; for with a quick motion he caught hold of his nephew, fell to the ground with him, and, with the aid of the Elder, began binding his hands with the girdle. They struggled for about five minutes. At last, with the help of the peasants, Doútlof rose, pulling his coat out of Elijah's clutch. Then he raised Elijah, whose hands were bound behind his back, and made him sit down in a corner on a bench.</p>
				<p>"I told you it would be the worse for you," he said, still out of breath with the struggle, and pulling straight the narrow girdle tied over his shirt.</p>
				<p>"What's the use of sinning? We shall all have to die!... Fold a coat for a pillow," he said, turning to the porter, "or the blood will get to his head." And he tied the cord round his waist over his sheepskin, and taking up the lantern, went to see after the horses.</p>
				<p>Elijah, pale, dishevelled, his shirt pulled out of place, was gazing round the room as if he were trying to remember where he was. The porter picked up the broken bits of glass, and stuck a coat into the hole in the window to keep out the draught. The Elder again sat down to his bowl.</p>
				<p>"Ah, Elijah, Elijah! I'm sorry for you, really! What's to be done? There's Harúshkin... he, too, is married. Seems it can't be helped!"</p>
				<p>"It's all on account of that fiend, my uncle, that I'm being ruined!" Elijah repeated, dryly and bitterly. "He is chary of his own!... Mother says the steward told him to buy a substitute. He won't; he says he can't afford it. As if what my brother and I have brought into his house were a trifle!... He is a fiend!"</p>
				<p>Doútlof returned, said his prayers in front of the icons, took off his outdoor things, and sat down beside the Elder. The cook brought more kvas and another spoon. Elijah was quiet, and closing his eyes lay down on the folded coat. The Elder, shaking his head silently, pointed to him. Doútlof waved his hand.</p>
				<p>"As if one was not sorry!... My own brother's son!... One is not only sorry, but it seems they also make me out a villain towards him.... Whether it's his wife... she's a cunning little woman though she's so young... that has put it into his head that we could afford to buy a substitute!... Anyhow, he's reproaching me. But one does pity the lad!..."</p>
				<p>"Ah! he's a fine lad," said the Elder.</p>
				<p>"But I'm at the end of my tether with him! To-morrow I shall let Ignát come, and his wife wanted to come too."</p>
				<p>"All right—let them come," said the Elder, rising and climbing on to the oven. "What is money? Money is dross!"</p>
				<p>"If one had the money, who would grudge it?" muttered one of the tradesman's men, lifting his head.</p>
				<p>"Ah, money, money! It's the cause of much sin," replied Doútlof. "Nothing in the world is the cause of so much sin, and the Scriptures say so too."</p>
				<p>"Everything is said there," the porter agreed. "There was a man told me how a merchant had stored up a heap of money and did not wish to leave any behind; he loved it so that he took it with him to the grave. As he was dying he asked to have a small pillow buried with him. No one suspected anything, and so it was done. Then the sons began to search for the money. Nothing was to be found. At last one of the sons guessed that probably the notes were all in the pillow. It went as far as the Tsar, and he allowed the grave to be opened. And what do you think? There was nothing in the pillow, but the coffin was full of creeping things, and so it was buried again.... You see what money does!"</p>
				<p>"It's a fact, it causes much sin," said Doútlof, and he got up and began to say his prayers.</p>
				<p>When he had finished, he looked at his nephew. The lad was asleep. Doútlof came up to him, loosened the girdle, and then lay down. One of the other peasants went out to sleep with the horses.</p>

				<p>As soon as all was quiet, Polikéy climbed down softly, like a guilty man, and began to get ready. Somehow he felt uneasy at the thought of spending the night there among the recruits. The cocks were already crowing more frequently, answering one another. Drum had eaten all his oats, and was straining towards the drinking-trough. Polikéy harnessed him and led him out, past the peasant carts. His cap, with its contents, was safe, and the wheels of his cart were soon rattling along the frozen Pokróvsk road.</p>
				<p>Polikéy felt easier only when he had left the town behind. Up to then he kept imagining that at any moment he might hear himself being pursued, that he would be stopped, and that in place of Elijah's arms his own would be bound behind his back, and he would be taken to the recruiting station next morning. It might have been the frost, or it might have been fear; but something made cold shivers run down his back, and again and again he kept touching up Drum with the whip. The first person he met was a priest in a tall fur cap, accompanied by a workman blind in one eye. Taking this for an evil omen, Polikéy grew still more alarmed; but outside the town this fear gradually passed. Drum went on at a walking pace; the road in front became more visible.</p>
				<p>Polikéy took off his cap and felt the notes. "Shall I hide it in my bosom?" he thought. "No; I should have to undo my girdle.... Wait a bit! When I get to the foot of the incline, I'll get down and arrange myself again.... The cap is sewn up tight at the top, and it can't fall through the lining. After all, I'd better not take the cap off till I get home."</p>
				<p>When he had reached the foot of the incline, Drum of his own accord trotted up the next hill, and Polikéy, who was as anxious as Drum to get home, did not check him. All was well—at any rate, so Polikéy imagined; and he gave himself up to dreams of his mistress's gratitude, of the five roubles which she would give him, and of the joy of his family. He took off his cap, felt for the envelope, and, smiling, put the cap tighter on his head. The velveteen crown of the cap was very rotten, and just because Akoulína had carefully sewn up the rents in one place, it burst open in another; and the very movement by which Polikéy in the dark had thought to push the envelope with the money deeper under the wadding, tore the cap farther, and pushed out a corner of the envelope through the velveteen crown.</p>
				<p>The dawn was appearing, and Polikéy, who had not slept all night, began to drowse. Pulling his cap lower down, and thereby pushing the envelope still farther out, Polikéy let his head droop forward towards the front of the cart. He awoke near home, and was about to catch hold of his cap; but, feeling that it sat firmly on his head, he did not take it off, convinced that the envelope was inside. He gave Drum a touch, arranged the hay in the cart again, put on the appearance of a well-to-do peasant, and, proudly looking about him, rattled homewards.</p>
				<p>There was the kitchen; there the domestic serfs' quarters. There was the joiner's wife carrying some linen cloth; there was the office, and there the house of the proprietress, where in a few moments Polikéy would be proving himself to be a trustworthy and honest man. "One can say anything about anybody," he would say; and the lady would reply, "Well, thank you, Polikéy! Here are three (or perhaps five, perhaps even ten) roubles," and she would order tea for him, or even vódka." It would not be amiss, after being out in the cold. With ten roubles we would have a treat on the holiday, and buy boots, and return Nikíta his four and a half roubles (it can't be helped!... He has begun bothering)...."</p>
				<p>When he was some hundred steps from his home, Polikéy wrapped his coat round him, pulled his girdle straight, took off his cap, smoothed his hair, and without haste thrust his hand inside the lining. The hand began to move faster and faster inside the lining, then the other hand went in too, while his face grew paler and paler. One of the hands went right through the cap.</p>
				<p>Polikéy fell on his knees, stopped the horse, and began searching in the cart among the hay and the things he had bought, feeling inside his coat and in his trouser pockets. The money was nowhere to be found.</p>
				<p>"Dear me! What does it mean?... What is going to happen?..." He began howling, clutching at his hair. But recollecting that he might be seen, he turned the horse back, pulled the cap on, and drove the dissatisfied Drum back along the road.</p>
				<p>"I can't bear going out with Polikéy," Drum must have thought." Once in all his life he has fed and watered me at the right time, and then only in order to deceive me so unpleasantly! How hard I tried to run home! I am tired, and hardly have we got within smell of our own hay before he starts driving me back!"</p>
				<p>"Now then, you devil's jade!" shouted Polikéy through his tears, standing up in the cart, pulling at Drum's mouth and beating him with the whip.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">X</h3>
				<p>All that day no one in Pokróvsk saw Polikéy. The mistress asked for him several times after dinner, and Aksyúta came flying to Akoulína; but Akoulína said he had not yet returned, and that evidently the customer had detained him, or something had happened to the horse. "If only it has not gone lame!" she said. "Last time, when Maxím went, he was on the road a whole day—had to walk back all the way."</p>
				<p>And Aksyúta turned her pendulums in the opposite direction, while Akoulína, trying to calm her own fears, invented reasons to account for her husband's absence; but in vain. Her heart was heavy, and she could not work with a will at any of the preparations for the morrow's holiday. She was suffering all the more because the joiner's wife assured her that she herself had seen "a man just like Polikoúshka drive up to the avenue, and then turn back again."</p>
				<p>The children were also anxiously expecting "Daddy," but for another reason. Annie and Mary, being left without the sheepskin and the coat which made it possible to take turns out of doors, could only run out in their indoor dresses, quickly and in a small circle round the house. This was not a little inconvenient for all the dwellers in the serfs' quarters who wanted to go in or out. Once Mary ran against the legs of the joiner's wife, who was carrying water, and though she began to howl in anticipation as soon as she knocked against the woman's knees, she got her hair pulled all the same, and cried still louder. When she did not knock against anyone, she flew in at the door, and, straightway climbing on a tub, got on to the top of the oven. Only the mistress and Akoulína were really anxious about Polikéy; the children were concerned only about what he had on.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch, in answer to the mistress's questions, "Has Polikoúshka not yet returned ?" and "Where can he be?" answered: "I can't say," and seemed pleased that his expectations were being fulfilled." He ought to have been back by dinner-time," said he significantly.</p>
				<p>All that day no one heard anything of Polikéy; only later on it was known that some neighbouring peasants had seen him running about on the road, bareheaded, and asking everybody whether they had seen a letter. Another man had seen him asleep by the roadside, beside a horse and cart tied up. "I thought he was tipsy," the man said; "and the horse looked as if it had not been fed for two days, its sides were so fallen in."</p>
				<p>Akoulína did not sleep all night, and kept listening; but Polikéy did not return that night. Had she been alone, and had she kept a cook and a maid, she would have felt still more unhappy; but as soon as the cocks crowed and the joiner's wife got up, Akoulína was obliged to rise and light the fire. It was a holiday. The bread had to come out of the oven before daybreak, kvas had to be made, cakes baked, the cow milked, dresses and shirts ironed, the children washed, and the neighbour not allowed to take up the whole of the oven. So Akoulína, still listening, set to work.</p>
				<p>It had grown light, and the church bells were ringing. The children were up, and Polikéy had still not returned. A little snow had fallen the day before, and lay in patches on the fields, on the road, and on the roofs; and now, as if in honour of the feast, the day was fair, sunny and frosty, so that one could see far and hear far.</p>
				<p>But Akoulína, standing by the brick oven, her head thrust into the opening in front, was so busy with her cakes that she did not hear Polikéy drive up, and knew only from the children's shouting that her husband had returned.</p>
				<p>Annie, as the eldest, had greased her hair and dressed herself without help. She wore a new but crumpled print dress—a present from the proprietress. It stuck out as stiff as if it were made of bark, and was a thorn in the neighbours' eyes; her hair was shining; she had smeared half an inch of tallow candle on to it. Her shoes, though not new, were respectable. Mary was still wrapped in the old jacket, and was covered with mud; and Annie would not let her come near for fear of getting dirtied. Mary was outside. She saw her father drive up, bringing a sack.</p>
				<p>"Daddy has come!" she shrieked, and rushed headlong in at the door, past Annie, dirtying her. Annie, no longer fearing the dirt, went for her at once and hit her. Akoulína could not leave her work, and only shouted at the children: "Now, then... I'll whip you all!" and glowered round at the door.</p>
				<p>Polikéy came in with the bag, and at once passed through to his own cubicle.</p>
				<p>It seemed to Akoulína that he was pale, and his face looked as if he were either smiling or crying, but she had no time to find out which it was.</p>
				<p>"Well, Polikéy, is it all right?" she called to him from the oven.</p>
				<p>Polikéy muttered something that she did not understand.</p>
				<p>"Eh?" she cried. "Have you been to the mistress?"</p>
				<p>Polikéy was sitting on the bed in their cubicle, looking wildly round him, and smiling his guilty, deeply sorrowful smile. He did not answer for a long time.</p>
				<p>"Eh, Polikéy? Why so long?" came Akoulína's voice.</p>
				<p>"Yes, Akoulína, I have handed the lady her money. How she thanked me!" he said suddenly, and began looking round and smiling still more uneasily. Two things attracted his feverishly staring eyes: the baby, and a rope attached to the cradle.</p>
				<p>He came up to where the cradle hung, and began hastily undoing the knot of the rope with his thin fingers. Then his eyes fixed themselves on the baby; but when Akoulína entered, carrying a board full of cakes, Polikéy quickly hid the rope in his bosom and sat down on the bed.</p>
				<p>"What is it, Polikéy? You seem not yourself," said Akoulína.</p>
				<p>"Haven't slept," he answered.</p>
				<p>Suddenly something flitted past the window, and in a moment Aksyúta, the maid from "up there," darted in like an arrow.</p>
				<p>"The mistress orders Polikéy to come this minute," she said—"this minute, Avdótya Nikoláyevna's orders are... this minute!"</p>
				<p>Polikéy looked at Akoulína, then at the girl.</p>
				<p>"I'm coming. What can she want?" he said, so simply that Akoulína grew quieter. "Perhaps she wants to reward me. Tell her I'm coming."</p>
				<p>He rose and went out. Akoulína took the washing-trough, put it on a bench, filled it with water from the pails which stood by the door and from the boiler in the oven, rolled up her sleeves, and felt the water.</p>
				<p>"Come, Mary, I'll wash you."</p>
				<p>The cross, lisping little girl began howling.</p>
				<p>"Come, you slattern! I'll give you a clean smock. Now then, don't make a fuss! Come along.... I've still your brother to wash."</p>
				<p>Meanwhile Polikéy had not followed the maid from "up there," but had gone to a very different place. In the passage, by the wall, was a step-ladder leading to the garret. Polikéy, when he came out, looked round, and not seeing anyone climbed that ladder almost at a run, nimbly and hurriedly.</p>
				<p>"What can it mean that Polikéy does not come?" asked the mistress impatiently of Dounyásha, who was dressing her hair. "Where is Polikéy? Why has he not come?"</p>
				<p>Aksyúta again flew to the serfs' quarters, and again rushed into the passage, calling Polikéy to her mistress.</p>
				<p>"Why, he went long ago," answered Akoulína, who, having washed Mary, had just put her baby-boy into the washing-trough, and was moistening his thin short hair, regardless of his cries. The boy screamed, puckered his face, and tried to catch hold of something with his helpless little hands. Akoulína supported his plump, dimpled little back with one large hand, while washing him with the other.</p>
				<p>"See if he has not fallen asleep somewhere," said she, looking round anxiously.</p>
				<p>Just then the joiner's wife, with her hair undone and her dress unfastened, and holding up her skirts, went up into the garret to get some things she had hung up to dry there. Suddenly a cry of horror filled the garret, and the joiner's wife, with her eyes closed, came down the steps on all fours, backwards, sliding rather than running, like a madwoman.</p>
				<p>"Polikéy!..." she screamed.</p>
				<p>Akoulína let go the baby.</p>
				<p>"Strangled!" bellowed the joiner's wife.</p>
				<p>Akoulína, paying no heed to the baby, who rolled over like a ball and fell backwards, with his little legs in the air and his head under water, rushed out into the passage.</p>
				<p>"On a rafter... hanging!" the joiner's wife ejaculated, but stopped when she saw Akoulína.</p>
				<p>Akoulína darted up the steps, and before anyone could stop her she was at the top; but from there with a terrible cry she fell back like a corpse; and would have been killed if the people who had come running from every cubicle had not been in time to catch her.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="polikoushka-11" epub:type="chapter">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XI</h3>
				<p>For several minutes no explanation could be arrived at amidst the general tumult. A crowd of people had collected, everyone was shouting and talking, children and old women were crying. Akoulína lay unconscious.</p>
				<p>At last the men—the joiner and the steward—who had run to the place, went up the ladder, and the joiner's wife began telling for the twentieth time how she, "nothing doubting, went to fetch a dress, and just looked—this wise—and see... a man... and I look, and a cap is lying inside-out, close by. I look... the legs are swinging.... I went cold all over! Is it pleasant?... To think of a man hanging himself, and that I should be the one to see him!... How I came clattering down I myself don't remember... it's a miracle how God saved me! Really, the Lord has had mercy on me!... Is it a trifle?... such steepness and from such a height.... Why, I might have been killed!"</p>
				<p>The men who had gone up had the same tale to tell. Polikéy, in his shirt and trousers, was hanging from a rafter by the rope which he had unfastened from the cradle. His cap, turned inside out, lay beside him, his coat and sheepskin were neatly folded, and lay close by. His feet touched the ground, but he no longer showed signs of life.</p>
				<p>Akoulína regained consciousness, and again rushed to the ladder, but was held back.</p>
				<p>"Mamma, Syómka's tsoking!" the lisping little girl suddenly cried from their cubicle. Akoulína tore herself away, and ran to her room. The baby did not stir, and his little legs were not moving. Akoulína snatched him out, but he did not breathe or move. She threw him down on the bed, and, with arms akimbo, burst into such loud, ringing, terrible laughter that Mary, who at first had started laughing herself, covered her ears with her hands, and ran out into the passage crying. The crowd thronged into the cubicle, wailing and weeping. They carried out the little body and began rubbing it, but in vain. Akoulína tossed about on the bed, and laughed—laughed so that all who heard her were frightened. Only now, seeing this motley crowd of men and women, old people and children, did one fully realize what a number, and what sort, of people lived in the serfs' quarters. Everybody fussed and spoke; many wept, but nobody did anything. The joiner's wife still found people who had not heard her tale about the way her tender feelings were shocked by the unexpected sight, and how God had saved her from falling down the ladder. An old man who had been a footman, with a woman's jacket thrown over his shoulders, was relating how in the days of the old proprietor a woman drowned herself in the pond. The steward sent messengers to the priest and to the policeman, and appointed men to keep guard. Aksyúta, the maid from "up there," kept gazing with staring eyes at the opening that led to the garret, and though she could not see anything, was unable to tear herself away and go back to her mistress. Agatha Miháylovna, who had been lady's-maid to the former proprietress, was weeping and asking for some tea to soothe her nerves. Anna, the midwife, was laying out the little body on the table, with her practised, plump, oily hands. Other women stood in front of Akoulína, silently looking at her. The children, huddled together in a corner, kept glancing at their mother and bursting into howls; and then, growing silent for a moment, glanced again, and huddled still closer. Boys and men thronged round the porch, looking in at the door and the windows with frightened faces; and, unable to see or understand anything, asking one another what it was all about. One said the joiner had chopped off his wife's foot with an axe. Another said that the laundress had borne triplets; a third, that the cook's cat had gone mad and bitten the people. But the truth gradually spread, and at last it reached the proprietress. And apparently no one understood how to prepare her! That rough Egór blurted the facts straight out to her, and so upset the lady's nerves that it was a long time before she could recover.</p>
				<p>The crowd had already begun to quiet down; the joiner's wife set the samovár to boil and made tea; and the outsiders—not being invited—thought it impolite to stay any longer. The boys began fighting outside the porch. Everybody now knew what had happened; and, crossing themselves, they began dispersing, when suddenly a cry was raised:</p>
				<p>"The mistress! The mistress!"</p>
				<p>And everybody crowded and pressed together to make way for her; but at the same time everybody wanted to see what she would do. The lady, pale and with tear-stained face, entered the passage, crossed the threshold, and went into Akoulína's cubicle. A dozen heads close together gazed in at the door. One pregnant woman was pushed so that she gave a squeak, but made use of that very circumstance to appropriate to herself a front place.</p>
				<p>And how could one help wishing to see the lady in Akoulína's cubicle? It was just like the coloured lights at the end of a performance. It must be an important occasion, since they burnt the coloured fires; and so it must be an important occasion when the lady in her silk and lace entered Akoulína's cubicle.</p>
				<p>The lady came up and took Akoulína's hand, but Akoulína snatched it away. The old domestic serfs shook their heads reprovingly.</p>
				<p>"Akoulína!" said the lady. "You have your children—have pity on yourself!"</p>
				<p>Akoulína burst out laughing and got up.</p>
				<p>"My children are all silver, all silver! I don't keep any paper money," she muttered very quickly. "I told Polikéy, 'Take no notes,' and there, now, they've buttered him, buttered him up with tar—tar and soap, madam! Whatever rash you may have, it will pass at once..." and she laughed still louder.</p>
				<p>The mistress turned round, and gave orders that the doctor's assistant should come with mustard poultices. "Bring some cold water," she said, and began looking for water herself; but, seeing the dead baby, with Anna the midwife beside it, the lady turned away, and everybody saw how she hid her face in her handkerchief and began to cry; while Anna (it was a pity the lady could not see her—she would have appreciated it, and it was all done for her sake) covered the baby with a piece of linen cloth, put his arms right with her plump, deft hands, shook her head, pouted, drooped her eyelids, and sighed with so much feeling that everybody could see how excellent a heart she had. But the lady did not see it; she could not see anything. She burst out sobbing, and went into hysterics.</p>

				<p>Akoulína went on laughing and talking nonsense. She was taken into another room and bled, and plastered over with mustard poultices, and ice was put on her head; but she did not come to her senses, and did not cry, but laughed, and kept doing and saying such things that the kind people who attended on her could not help laughing too.</p>
