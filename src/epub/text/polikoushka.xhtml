				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam! Only it would be a pity if it's the Doútlofs. They're all good fellows, and one of them must go if we don't send at least one of the domestic serfs," said the steward. "As it is, everyone is hinting at them.... But it's just as you please, madam!"</p>
				<p>And he placed his right hand over his left in front of him, inclined his head towards the other shoulder, drew in—almost with a smack—his thin lips, rolled up his eyes, and said no more, evidently intending to keep silent for a long time, and to listen without reply to all the absurdities his mistress was sure to utter.</p>
				<p>The steward—clean-shaven, and dressed in a long coat of a peculiar steward-like cut—who had come to report to his proprietress that autumn evening, was by origin a domestic serf.</p>
				<p>The report, from the lady's point of view, meant listening to a statement of the business done on her estate, and giving instructions for further business. From Egór Miháylovitch's (the steward's) point of view, "reporting" was a ceremony of standing straight on both feet, with turned-out toes, in a corner facing the sofa, and listening to all sorts of chatter unconnected with business, and by different ways and means getting the mistress into a state of mind in which she would quickly and impatiently say, "All right, all right!" to all that Egór Miháylovitch proposed.</p>
				<p>Recruiting was the business under consideration. The Pokróvsk estate had to supply three recruits. Two of them seemed to have been marked out by Fate itself, by a coincidence of family, moral, and economic circumstances. As far as they were concerned, there could be no hesitation or dispute either on the part of the proprietress, the Commune, or of public opinion. But who the third was to be, was a debatable point. The steward was anxious to defend the Doútlofs (in which family there were three men of an age to be recruited), and to send Polikoúshka, a married domestic serf with a very bad reputation, who had been caught more than once stealing sacks, reins, and hay; but the proprietress, who often petted Polikoúshka's ragged children, and improved his morals by exhortations from the Bible, did not wish to send him. Neither did she wish to injure the Doútlofs, whom she did not know and had never even seen. But somehow she did not seem able to grasp the fact, and the steward could not make up his mind to tell her straight out, that if Polikoúshka did not go, one of the Doútlofs would have to.</p>
				<p>"But I don't wish the Doútlofs any ill!" she said feelingly.</p>
				<p>"If you don't, then pay three hundred roubles for a substitute," should have been the steward's reply; but that would have been bad policy.</p>
				<p>So Egór Miháylovitch took up a comfortable position, and even leaned imperceptibly against the lintel of the door, while keeping a servile expression on his face and watching the movements of the lady's lips and the flutter of the frills on her cap, and their shadow on the wall beneath a picture. But he did not consider it at all necessary to attend to the meaning of her words. The lady spoke long, and said much. A desire to yawn gave him cramp behind his ears, but he adroitly turned the spasm into a cough, and, holding his hand to his mouth, gave a croak. A little while ago I saw Lord Palmerston sitting with his hat over his face while a member of the Opposition was storming at the Ministry, and then suddenly rise, and in a three hours' speech answer his opponent point by point. I saw it and was not surprised, because I had seen the same kind of thing hundreds of times going on between Egór Miháylovitch and his mistress. At last—perhaps he was afraid of falling asleep, or thought she was letting herself go too far—changing the weight of his body from his left to his right foot, he began, as he always did, with an unctuous preface:</p>
				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam.... Only, the meeting of the Commune is at present being held in front of my office window, and we must come to some conclusion. The order says that the recruits are to be in town before the Feast of Pokróf.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a> From among the peasants the Doútlofs are being suggested, and there is no one else to suggest. And the Mír does not trouble about your interests. What does it care if it ruins the Doútlofs? Don't I know what a fight they've been having? Ever since I first had the stewardship they have been living in want. The old man's youngest nephew has scarcely had time to grow up to be a help, and now they're to be ruined again! And I, as you well know, am as careful of your property as of my own.... It's a pity, madam, whatever you're pleased to think!... After all, they're neither kith nor kin to me, and I've received nothing from them...."</p>
				<p>"Why, Egór, as if I ever thought of such a thing!" interrupted the lady, and at once suspected him of having been bribed by the Doútlofs.</p>
				<p>"... Only theirs is the best homestead in the whole of Pokróvsk. They're God-fearing, hard-working peasants. The old man has been thirty years churchwarden; he doesn't drink nor use bad language; he goes to church" (the steward well knew with what to bait the hook). "... But the principal thing that I would like to report to you is that he has only two sons; the others are nephews adopted out of charity, and so they ought to cast lots only with the two-men families. Many families have split up because of their improvidence, and their own sons have separated from them, and so they are safe now—while these will have to suffer just because of their charitableness."</p>
				<p>Here the lady could not follow at all. She did not understand what he meant by a "two-men family" nor "charitableness." She only heard sounds and observed the nankeen buttons on the steward's coat. The top one, which he probably did not button up so often, was fixed on tightly; the middle one was hanging by a thread, and ought long ago to have been sewn on. But it is a well-known fact that in a conversation, especially a business conversation, it is not at all necessary to understand what is being said to you, but only to remember what you yourself want to say. The lady acted accordingly.</p>
				<p>"How is it you won't understand, Egór Miháylovitch?" she said. "I have not the least desire that a Doútlof should go as a soldier. One would think that, knowing me as you do, you might credit me with the wish to do everything in my power to help my serfs, and that I don't desire their misfortune, and that I would sacrifice all I possess to escape from this sad necessity and to send neither Doútlof nor Polikoúshka." (I don't know whether it occurred to the steward that to escape the sad necessity there was no need to sacrifice everything—that, in fact, three hundred roubles would be sufficient; but this thought might easily have occurred to him.)</p>
				<p>"I will only say this: that I will not give up Polikoúshka on any account. When, after that affair with the clock, he confessed to me of his own accord, and cried, and gave his word to amend, I talked to him for a long time, and saw that he was touched and sincerely penitent." ("There! She's off now!" thought Egór Miháylovitch, and began examining the marmalade she had in a glass of water: was it orange or lemon? "Slightly bitter, I expect," thought he.) "That is seven months ago now, and he has not once been drunk, and has behaved splendidly. His wife tells me he is a different man. How can you wish me to punish him now that he has reformed? Besides, it would be inhuman to make a soldier of a man who has five children, and he the only man in the family.... No, you'd better not say any more about it, Egór!"</p>
				<p>And the lady took a sip out of the glass. Egór Miháylovitch watched the motion of her throat as the liquid passed down it, and then replied shortly and dryly:</p>
				<p>"Then Doútlof's decided on."</p>
				<p>The lady clasped her hands together.</p>
				<p>"How is it you don't understand? Do I wish Doútlof ill? Have I anything against him? God is my witness, I am prepared to do anything for them...." (She glanced at a picture in the corner, but recollected that it was not an icon.) "Well, never mind... that's not to the point," she thought. And again, strange to say, the idea of the three hundred roubles did not occur to her.... "Well, what can I do? What do I know about it? It's impossible for me to know. Well, then, I rely on you—you know my wishes.... Act so as to satisfy everybody and according to the law.... What's to be done? They are not the only ones: everybody has times of trouble. Only, Polikoúshka can't be sent. You must understand that it would be dreadful of me to do such a thing...."</p>
				<p>She was roused, and would have continued speaking for a long time had not one of her maidservants entered the room at that moment.</p>
				<p>"What is it, Dounyásha?"</p>
				<p>"A peasant has come to ask Egór Miháylovitch if the Meeting is to wait for him," said Dounyásha, and glanced angrily at Egór Miháylovitch. ("Oh, that steward!" she thought; "he's upset the mistress. Now she'll not let one get a wink of sleep till two in the morning!")</p>
				<p>"Well then Egór, go and do the best you can."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam." He did not say anything more about Doútlof. "And who is to go to the fruit merchant to fetch the money?"</p>
				<p>"Has not Peter returned from town?"</p>
				<p>"No, madam."</p>
				<p>"Could not Nicholas go?"</p>
				<p>"Father is down with backache," remarked Dounyásha.</p>
				<p>"Should I go myself to-morrow, madam?" asked the steward.</p>
				<p>"No, Egór; you are wanted here." The lady pondered. "How much is it?"</p>
				<p>"Four hundred and sixty-two silver roubles."</p>
				<p>"Send Polikoúshka," said the lady, with a determined glance at Egór Miháylovitch's face.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch stretched his lips into the semblance of a smile, but without unclosing his teeth, and the expression of his face did not change.</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam."</p>
				<p>"Send him to me."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam;" and Egór Miháylovitch went to his office.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>
				<p>Polikéy (or Polikoúshka, as he was usually contemptuously called), as a man of little importance, of tarnished reputation, and not a native of the village, had no influence either with the housekeeper, the butler, the steward, or the lady's-maid. His cubicle was the very worst, though his family consisted of seven persons. The late proprietor had had these cubicles built in the following manner:</p>
				<p>In the middle of a brick building, about twenty-three feet square, was placed a large brick baking-oven, partly surrounded by a passage, and the four corners of the building were separated from the "collidor" (as the domestic serfs called it) by wooden stable-partitions. So there was not much room in these cubicles, especially in Polikéy's, which was nearest to the door. The family bed, with a quilt and pillow-cases made of print, the baby's cradle, and the three-legged table (on which the cooking and washing were done and all sorts of domestic articles placed, and at which Polikéy—who was a farrier—worked), tubs, clothing, some chickens, a calf, and the seven members of the family, filled the whole cubicle, and could not have moved in it had it not been for their quarter of the brick oven (on which both people and things could lie) and for the possibility of going outside into the porch. That was, perhaps, not easy, for it is rather cold in October, and the seven of them only possessed one sheepskin cloak between them; but, on the other hand, the children could keep warm by running about, and the grown-ups by working, and both the one and the other by climbing on to the top of the oven, where the temperature rose to 120 degrees. It may seem dreadful to live in such conditions, but they did not mind—it was quite possible to live. Akoulína washed and sewed her husband's and her children's clothes, spun, wove and bleached her linen, cooked and baked in the common oven, and quarrelled and gossiped with her neighbours. The monthly allowance of meal sufficed not only for the children, but to add to the cow's food. The firewood was free, and so was food for the cattle, and a little hay from the stables sometimes came their way. They had a strip of kitchen garden. Their cow had calved, and they had their own fowls. Polikéy was employed in the stables to look after two stallions; he bled horses and cattle, cleaned their hoofs, operated on them for lampers, dispensed ointments of his own invention, and for this was paid in money and in kind. Also some of the proprietress's oats used to remain over, for two measures of which a peasant in the village gave twenty pounds of mutton regularly every month. Life would have been quite tolerable, wad there been no worry. But the family had a great grief. Polikéy in his youth had lived at a stud-farm in another village. The stud-groom into whose hands he happened to fall was the greatest thief in the neighbourhood, and got exiled to Siberia. Under this man Polikéy served his apprenticeship, and in his youth got so used to those tricks that in later life, though he would willingly have left them off, he could not get out of the habit. He was a young man, and weak; he had neither father nor mother nor anyone else to teach him. Polikéy liked drink, and did not like to see anything lying about. Whether it was a strap, a piece of harness, a padlock, a bolt, or a thing of greater value, Polikéy found some use for everything. There were people everywhere who accepted these things, and paid for them in drink or in money. Such earnings, so people say, are the easiest to get: no apprenticeship required, no labour nor anything, and he who has once tried that kind of work does not desire any other. It has only one drawback: although you get things cheap and easily, and live pleasantly, yet all of a sudden—through somebody's malice—things go all wrong, the trade fails, everything has to be accounted for at once, and you rue the day you were born.</p>
				<p>And so it happened to Polikéy.</p>
				<p>Polikéy married, and God gave him joy. His wife, the daughter of a herdsman, turned out to be a healthy, intelligent, hard-working woman, who bore him one fine baby after another. And though Polikéy did not give up his trade, all went well till one fine day his luck forsook him and he was caught. And it was all about a trifle: he stole some reins from a peasant. He was found out, beaten, the proprietress was told of it; and he was watched. He was caught a second and a third time. People began to taunt him, the steward threatened to make him go as a soldier, the proprietress gave him a scolding, and his wife wept and was broken-hearted. Everything went wrong. He was a kind-hearted man; not wicked, but only weak; liking drink, and so in the habit of it that he could not leave it off. Sometimes his wife would row at him and even beat him when he came home drunk, and he would cry, saying: "Unfortunate man that I am, what shall I do? Blast my eyes, I'll leave it off! Never again!" A month goes by, and he leaves home, gets drunk, and is not seen again for a couple of days. And his neighbours say: "He must get the money somewhere to go on the spree with!"</p>
				<p>His latest trouble had been about the office clock. There was an old clock there that had not been in working order for a long time. He happened to go in at the open door all alone, and the clock tempted him. He took it and got rid of it in the town. As ill-luck would have it, the shopman to whom he sold the clock was related to one of the domestic serfs; and coming to see her one holiday, spoke about the clock. They—especially the steward, who disliked Polikéy—began making inquiries, just as if it was anybody else's concern! It was all found out and reported to the proprietress, and she sent for him. He at once fell at her feet and pathetically confessed everything, just as his wife had told him to do. He carried out his instructions very well. The proprietress began admonishing him; she talked and talked, and maundered on about God and virtue and a future life, and about wife and children, and at last drove him to tears. She said:</p>
				<p>"I forgive you; only you must promise never to do it again!"</p>
				<p>"Never in all my life. May I go to perdition! May my bowels gush out!" said Polikéy, and wept touchingly.</p>
				<p>Polikéy went home, and for the rest of the day lay on the oven, blubbering like a calf. Since then nothing more had ever been traced to him. Only his life was no longer pleasant; he was looked upon as a thief, and when the time for conscripting drew near, everybody hinted at him.</p>
				<p>Polikéy was a farrier, as already mentioned. How he became one nobody knew, he himself least of all. At the stud-farm, when he worked under the head-groom who got exiled, his only duties were to clean the stables, sometimes to groom the horses, and to carry water. So he could not have learned his trade there. Then he became a weaver; after that he worked in a garden, weeding the paths; then he was condemned to break bricks for some offence; then he went into service with a merchant, paying a yearly fine to his proprietress for permission to do so. So evidently he could not have had any experience as a veterinary; yet somehow during his last stay at home, his reputation as a wonderfully and even a rather supernaturally clever farrier began gradually to spread. He bled a horse once or twice; then threw one down and prodded about in its thigh, and then demanded that it should be placed in a stall, where he began cutting its frog till it bled. Though the horse struggled, and even squealed, he said this meant "letting out the sub-hoof blood"! Then he explained to a peasant that it was absolutely necessary to let the blood from both veins, "for greater lightness," and began hammering in the blunt lancet with a mallet; then he bandaged the innkeeper's horse under its belly with the selvedge torn from his wife's shawl, and at last he began to sprinkle all sorts of sores with vitriol, to drench them with something out of a bottle, and sometimes to give internally whatever came into his head. And the more horses he tormented and killed, the more he was believed in, and the more of them were brought to him.</p>
				<p>I feel that for us educated people it would hardly be proper to laugh at Polikéy. The methods he employed are the same that have influenced our fathers, that influence us, and will influence our children. The peasant lying prone on the head of his one mare (which not only constitutes the whole of his wealth, but is almost one of his family) and gazing with faith and horror at Polikéy's frowning look of importance and thin arms with upturned sleeves, as, with the healing rag or a bottle of vitriol between his teeth, the latter presses the sore place and boldly cuts into the living flesh (with the secret thought, "The one-eyed brute will never get over it!") and at the same time pretending to know where there is blood and where matter, which is a tendon and which a vein—that peasant cannot conceive that Polikéy has lifted his hand to cut, without due knowledge. He himself could not have done it. And once the thing is done, he will not reproach himself with having given permission to cut unnecessarily. I don't know about you, but I have experienced just the same with the doctor, who in obedience to my request was tormenting those dear to me. The lancet, the whitish bottle of sublimate, and the words, "the staggers—glanders—to let blood or matter," etc., do they not come to the same thing as "nerves, rheumatism, organism," etc.? <i xml:lang="de">Wage du zu irren und zu träume</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-206" id="noteref-206" epub:type="noteref">206</a> does not refer to poets so much as to doctors and veterinary surgeons.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
				<p>On the evening when the village Meeting, in the cold darkness of an October night, was choosing the recruits and vociferating in front of the office, Polikéy sat on the edge of his bed, rubbing down some horse medicine upon the table with a bottle; but what it was, he himself did not know. He had there sublimate of mercury, sulphur, Glauber's salts, and some kind of herb which he had gathered, having once imagined it to be good for broken wind, and now considered not useless in other disorders. The children had already gone to bed—two on the oven, two on the bed, and one in the cradle beside which Akoulína sat spinning. The remainder of a candle—one of the proprietress's candles which had not been put away carefully enough—was burning in a wooden candlestick on the window-sill, and Akoulína every now and then got up to snuff it with her fingers, so that her husband should not have to break off his important occupation. There existed independent thinkers who regarded Polikéy as a worthless farrier and a worthless man. Others, the majority, considered him a bad man, but a great master of his art; but Akoulína, though she often scolded and even beat her husband, thought him the first among farriers and the first among men. Polikéy sprinkled some kind of specific on to the palm of his hand (he never used a balance, and spoke ironically about the Germans who use balances: "This is not a pharmacy," he used to say). Polikéy weighed the specific in his hand and tossed it up, but there did not seem enough of it, and he poured in ten times as much. "I'll put in the lot," he said to himself. "It will pick 'em up better."</p>
				<p>Akoulína quickly turned round at the sound of the autocrat's voice, expecting some order; but, seeing that the business did not concern her, shrugged her shoulders.</p>
				<p>"What knowledge!... Where does he get it?" she thought, and went on spinning. The paper which had held the specific fell to the floor. Akoulína did not let this pass unnoticed.</p>
				<p>"Annie," she cried, "look! Father has dropped something. Pick it up!"</p>
				<p>Annie put out her thin little bare legs from under the cloak with which she was covered, slid down under the table like a kitten, and got the paper.</p>
				<p>"Here, daddy," she said, and with her little chilled feet darted back into bed.</p>
				<p>"Don't puth!" squeaked her lisping younger sister sleepily.</p>
				<p>"I'll give it you!" muttered Akoulína; and both heads disappeared again under the cloak.</p>
				<p>"He'll give me three roubles," said Polikéy, corking up the bottle. "I'll cure the horse. It's even too cheap," he added, "brain-splitting work!... Akoulína, go and ask Nikíta for a little 'baccy. I'll return it to-morrow;" and Polikéy took out of his trouser-pocket a limewood pipe-stem which had once been painted, with a mouthpiece of sealing-wax, and began fixing it on to the bowl.</p>
				<p>Akoulína left her spindle and went out, managing to steer clear of everything—though this was not easy. Polikéy opened the cupboard and put away the medicine, then tilted a vódka bottle into his mouth, but it was empty, and he made a grimace; but when his wife brought the tobacco he sat down on the edge of the bed after filling and lighting his pipe, and his face shone with the content and pride of a man who has completed his day's task. Whether he was thinking how on the morrow he would catch hold of a horse's tongue and pour his wonderful mixture down its throat, or considering the fact that a useful person never gets a refusal—"There, now! Hadn't Nikíta sent him some tobacco?"—anyhow, he felt happy.</p>
				<p>Suddenly the door, hanging on one hinge, was thrown open, and a maidservant from <em>up there</em>—not the second maid, but the third, the little one that was kept to run errands—entered the cubicle. (<em>Up there</em>, as everyone knows, means the proprietor's house, even if it is situated lower down.) Aksyúta—that was the girl's name—always flew like a bullet, and did it without bending her arms, which, keeping time with the speed of her flight, swung like pendulums, not by her sides, but in front of her. Her cheeks were always redder than her pink dress, and her tongue moved as rapidly as her legs. She flew into the room, and for some reason catching hold of the stove, began to sway to and fro; then, as if reluctant on any account to bring out more than two or three words at a time, she all of a sudden breathlessly addressed Akoulína as follows:</p>
				<p>"The mistress... has given orders... that Polikoúshka should come this minute... orders to come up...."</p>
				<p>She stopped, breathing heavily.</p>
				<p>"Egór Miháylovitch has been with the mistress... they talked about <em>rickruits</em>... they mentioned Polikoúshka... Avdótya Nikoláyevna... has ordered you to come this minute... Avdótya Nikoláyevna has ordered..." again a sigh," to come this minute...."</p>
				<p>For half a minute Aksyúta looked round at Polikéy and at Akoulína and the children—who had put out their heads from under their bed-clothes—picked up a nutshell that lay on the stove, and threw it at little Annie. Then she repeated:</p>
				<p>"To come this minute!..." and rushed out of the room like a whirlwind, the pendulums swinging as usual at right angles to the line of her flight.</p>
				<p>Akoulína again rose, and got her husband's boots—abominable soldier's boots, with holes in them—and got down his coat and passed it to him without speaking.</p>
				<p>"Won't you change your shirt, Polikéy?"</p>
				<p>"No," he answered.</p>
				<p>Akoulína never once looked at his face while he put on his boots and coat, and she did well not to look. Polikéy's face was pale, his nether jaw trembled, and in his eyes there was that tearful, submissive and deeply mournful look one only sees in the eyes of kindly, weak, and guilty people.</p>
				<p>He combed his hair, and was going out; but his wife stopped him, hid the string of his shirt that hung down from under his coat, and put his cap on for him.</p>
				<p>"What's that, Polikoúshka? Has the mistress sent for you?" came the voice of the carpenter's wife from behind the partition.</p>
				<p>Only that morning the carpenter's wife had had high words with Akoulína about her pot of potash<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-207" id="noteref-207" epub:type="noteref">207</a> that Polikéy's children had upset, and at first she was pleased to hear Polikéy being summoned to the mistress: most likely for no good. She was a cute, diplomatic lady, with a biting tongue. Nobody knew better than she how to pay anyone out with a word: so she imagined.</p>
				<p>"I expect you'll be sent to town to do the shopping," she continued. "I suppose a safe person must be chosen to do that job, so you'll be sent! Please buy a quarter of a pound of tea for me there, Polikéy."</p>
				<p>Akoulína forced back her tears, and an angry expression distorted her lips. She felt as if she could have clutched "that vixen the joiner's wife, by her mangy hair." But when she looked at her children, and thought that they would be left fatherless and she herself a soldier's wife and as good as widowed, she forgot the sharp-tongued joiner's wife, hid her face in her hands, sat down on the bed, and let her head sink in the pillows.</p>
				<p>"Mammy, you cluth me!" lisped her little girl, pulling the cloak with which she was covered from under her mother's elbow.</p>
				<p>"If you'd only die, all of you! I've brought you into the world for nothing but sorrow!" exclaimed Akoulína, and sobbed aloud, to the joy of the joiner's wife, who had not yet forgotten the potash.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="polikoushka-4" epub:type="chapter">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">IV</h3>
				<p>Half an hour passed. The baby began to cry. Akoulína rose and gave it the breast. Weeping no longer, but resting her thin, though still handsome, face on her hand, and fixing her eyes on the last flickerings of the candle, she sat thinking why she had married, wondering why so many soldiers were needed, and also how she could pay out the joiner's wife.</p>
				<p>She heard her husband's footsteps; and, wiping her tears, got up to let him pass. Polikéy entered like a conqueror, threw his cap on the bed, puffed, and unfastened his belt.</p>
				<p>"Well, what did she want?"</p>
				<p>"H'm! Of course! Polikoúshka is the least among men... but when there's business to be done, who's wanted? Why, Polikoúshka...."</p>
				<p>"What business?"</p>
				<p>Polikéy did not hasten to reply. He lit his pipe and spat.</p>
				<p>"To go and get money from a tradesman."</p>
				<p>"To fetch money?" Akoulína asked.</p>
				<p>Polikéy chuckled and wagged his head.</p>
				<p>"Ah! Ain't she clever at words?... 'You have been regarded,' she says, ' as an untrustworthy man; but I trust you more than another'" (Polikéy spoke in a loud voice that the neighbours might hear). "'You promised me you'd reform; here,' she says, 'is the first proof that I believe you. Go,' she says, 'to the customer, fetch the money he owes, and bring it back to me.' And I say: 'We all are your serfs, ma'am,' I say, 'and I must serve you as we serve the Lord; therefore I feel myself that I can do anything for Your Honour, and cannot refuse any kind of job; whatever you order I will fulfil, because I am your slave.'" (He again smiled that peculiar weak, kindly, guilty smile.) "'Well, then,' she says, 'you will do it faithfully?... You understand,' she says, 'that your fate depends on it?'—'How could I help understanding that I can do something? If they have told tales about me—well, anyone can tell tales about anybody... but I never in any way, I believe, have even had a thought against Your Honour...' In a word, I buttered her up till my lady was quite softened.... 'I shall think highly of you,' she says." (He kept silent a minute, then the smile again appeared on his face.) "I know very well how to talk to the likes of them! Formerly, when I used to pay for the right to work on my own, one of them would come down hard on me; but only let me say a word or two... I'd butter him up till he'd be as smooth as silk!"</p>
				<p>"Is it much?"</p>
				<p>"Three half-thousands of roubles," carelessly replied Polikéy.</p>
				<p>She shook her head.</p>
				<p>"When are you to go?"</p>
				<p>"'To-morrow,' she says. 'Take any horse you like,' she says, 'call at the office, and then start, in Heaven's name!'"</p>
				<p>"Glory to the Lord!" said Akoulína, rising and crossing herself.</p>
				<p>"May God help you, Polikéy," she added in a whisper, so that she should not be heard behind the partition, holding him by his shirt-sleeve. "Polikéy, listen to me! I beseech you in the name of Christ our God: when you start, kiss the cross and promise that not a drop shall pass your lips."</p>
				<p>"A likely thing!" he ejaculated; "drink when carrying all that money!... Ah! how somebody was playing the piano up there! Fine!..." he said, after a pause, and smiled. "I suppose it's the young lady. I was standing like this, in front of the mistress, beside the what-not, and the young lady was careering away behind the door. She rattled, rattled on, fitting it together so pat! Oh my! Wouldn't I like to play a tune! I'd soon master it, I would. I'm awfully good at that sort of thing.... Get me a clean shirt, do, to-morrow!"</p>
				<p>And they went to bed happy.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">V</h3>
				<p>Meanwhile the Meeting had been vociferating in front of the office. The business before them was not a trifling one. Almost all the peasants were present. While the steward was with the proprietress they put on their caps, more voices joined in, and they talked more loudly. The hum of the deep voices, at rare intervals interrupted by breathless hoarse and shrill tones, filled the air, and entering through the windows of the proprietress's house sounded like the noise of the distant sea, making her feel a nervous agitation resembling that produced by a heavy thunderstorm—a sensation between fear and discomfort. She felt as if the voices might at any moment grow yet louder and faster, and then something would happen.</p>
				<p>"As if it could not all be done quietly, peaceably, without disputing and shouting," she thought, "according to the Christian law of brotherly love and meekness!"</p>
				<p>Many voices were speaking at once, but Theodore Resoún, a carpenter, shouted loudest. There were two grown-up young men in his family, and he was attacking the Doútlofs. Old Doútlof was defending himself: he had stepped forward out of the crowd behind which he had at first stood. Now spreading out his arms, now clutching at his little beard, he sputtered and snuffled in such a manner that it would have been hard for himself to understand what he was saying. His sons and nephews—splendid fellows, all of them—stood pressing behind him, and the old man resembled the mother-hen in the game of hawk-and-chickens. The hawk was Resoún; and not only Resoún, but all the men who had two grown lads in their family, were attacking Doútlof. The point was, that Doútlof's brother had been recruited thirty years before, and that Doútlof wished to be excused therefore from taking his turn with the families in which there were three grown-up young men, and wanted his brother's service in the army to be counted to the advantage of his family, so that it should be given the same chance as those in which there were only two young men; and that these should all draw lots equally, and the third recruit be chosen from among all of them. Besides Doútlof's family, there were four others in which there were three young men, but one was the village elder's family, and the proprietress had exempted him. From the second, a recruit had been taken the year before, and from the remaining families two recruits were now being taken. One of them had not even come to this Meeting, only his wife stood sorrowfully behind all the others, vaguely expecting that the wheel of fortune might somehow turn her way. The red-haired Román, the father of the other recruit, in a tattered coat—though he was not poor—hung his head and silently leant against the porch railing, only now and then attentively looking up at anybody who raised his voice, and then hanging his head again. Misery seemed to breathe from his whole figure. Old Simeon Doútlof was a man to whose keeping anyone who knew him would have trusted hundreds and thousands of roubles. He was a steady, God-fearing, well-to-do man, and was churchwarden. Therefore the predicament in which he found himself was all the more startling.</p>
				<p>Resoún the carpenter was a tall, dark man, a riotous drunkard, very smart in a dispute and in arguing with workmen, tradespeople, peasants, and gentlefolk at meetings and fairs. He was quiet now and sarcastic, and from his superior height he was crushing down the spluttering churchwarden with the whole strength of his ringing voice and oratorical talent. The churchwarden was exasperated out of his usual sober groove. Besides these, the youngish, round-faced, square-headed, curly-bearded, thick-set Garáska Kopýlof, one of the talkers of the younger generation, was taking part in the dispute. He came next to Resoún in importance. He had already gained some weight at the Meetings, having distinguished himself by his trenchant speeches. Then there was Theodore Mélnitchny, a tall, thin, yellow-faced, round-shouldered man, still young, with a thin beard and small eyes, always embittered and gloomy, seeing the dark side of everything, and often puzzling the Meeting by his unexpected and abrupt questions and remarks. Both these speakers sided with Resoún. Besides these, now and then two chatterers joined in: one with a most good-humoured face and flowing brown beard, called Hrapkóf, who kept repeating the words, "Oh, my dearest friend!" the other, Zhidkóf, a little fellow with a bird-like face, who also kept remarking at every opportunity, "That's how it is, brothers mine!" addressing himself to everybody and speaking fluently, but without rhyme or reason. They both sided first with one and then with the other party, but no one listened to them. There were others like them, but these two, who kept moving through the crowd and shouting louder than anybody and frightening the proprietress, were listened to less than anyone else, and, intoxicated by the noise and shouting, gave themselves up entirely to the pleasure of wagging their tongues.</p>
				<p>There were many other characters among the members of the Commune, stern, respectable, indifferent, dismal, or down-trodden; and there were women standing behind the men, but, God willing, I'll speak of them some other time. The greater part of the crowd, however, consisted of peasants who stood as if they were in church, whispering behind each other's backs about home affairs, about how best to mark the trees in the forest, or silently hoping that the jabbering would soon cease. There were also rich peasants, whose well-being the Meeting could not add to nor diminish. Such was Ermíl, with his broad, shiny face, whom the peasants called the "full-bellied," because he was rich. Such too was Stárostin, whose face seemed to say, "You may talk away, but no one will touch me! I have four sons, but not one of them will have to go." Now and then these two were attacked by some independent thinker such as Kopýlof or Resoún, but they replied quietly and firmly, and with a sense of their own immunity. If Doútlof was like the mother-hen in the game of hawk-and-chickens, his lads did not much resemble the chicks. They did not flutter about and squeak, but stood quietly behind him. His eldest son, Ignát, was already thirty; the second, too, was already a married man, and, moreover, not fit for service; the third was his nephew Elijah, who had just got married—a fair, rosy young man in a smart sheepskin coat (he was post-horse driver). He stood looking at the crowd, sometimes scratching his head under his hat, as if the whole matter was no concern of his, though it was just him that the hawks wished to swoop down on.</p>
				<p>"Why, my grandfather was a soldier," said one, "and so I might in just the same way refuse to draw lots!... There's no such law, friend. Last recruiting, Mihéyevitch was enlisted, and his uncle had then not even returned from service."</p>
				<p>"Neither your father nor any uncle of yours has served the Tsar," Doútlof was saying at the same time." Why, you have not even served the proprietress or the Commune, but spend all your time in the pub. Your sons have separated from you because it's impossible to live with you, so you go suggesting other people's sons for recruits! And I have done police duty for ten years and been churchwarden. Twice I have suffered from fires, and no one helped me over it; and now, because things go on peaceably and honourably in my homestead, am I to be ruined?... Give me my brother back, then! I dare say he has died in service.... Judge righteously, according to God's will, Christian Commune, and don't listen to a drunkard's drivel."</p>
				<p>And at the same time Gerásim was saying to Doútlof:</p>
				<p>"You are using your brother as an excuse, but he was not enlisted by the Commune. He was sent by the proprietor because of his evil ways, so he is no excuse for you."</p>
				<p>Gerásim had not finished when the long, yellow-faced Theodore Mélnitchny stepped forward and began dismally:</p>
				<p>"Yes, that's the way! The proprietors send whom they list, and then the Commune has got to get the muddle straight. The Commune has chosen your lad, and if you don't like it, go and ask the lady. Perhaps she will order me, the one man of the family, to leave my children and go!... There's law for you!" he said bitterly, and, waving his hand, he returned to his former place.</p>
				<p>The red-haired Román, whose son had been chosen as a recruit, raised his head and muttered: "That's it, that's it!" and even sat down on the step in vexation.</p>
				<p>But these were not the only ones who were speaking all at once. Besides those behind, who were talking about their own affairs, the chatterers did not neglect their part.</p>
				<p>"And so it is, faithful Commune," said the little Zhidkóf, repeating Doútlof's words. "One must judge in a Christian manner.... In a Christian way, I mean, brothers, we must judge."</p>
				<p>"One must judge according to one's conscience, my dear friend," spoke the good-humoured Hrapkóf, repeating Kopýlof's words, and pulling Doútlof by his sheepskin.</p>
				<p>"That was the proprietor's will, and not the decision of the Commune."</p>
				<p>"That's right! That's what it is," said others.</p>
				<p>"What drunkard is drivelling?" Resoún retorted to Doútlof. "Did you stand me any drinks? Or is your son, whom they pick up by the roadside, going to reproach me with drink?... Friends, we must decide! If you want to spare Doútlof, choose not only out of families with two men, but even the one man of a family, and he will have the laugh of us!"</p>
				<p>"Doútlof's will have to go! What's the good of talking?"</p>
				<p>"It's evident the three-men families must be the first to draw lots," began different voices.</p>
				<p>"We must first see what the proprietress will say. Egór Miháylovitch was saying that they wanted to send a domestic serf," put in a voice.</p>
				<p>This remark stopped the dispute for a while, but soon it flared up anew, and again came down to personalities.</p>
				<p>Ignát, whom Resoún had accused of being picked up drunk by the roadside, began to make out that Resoún had stolen a saw from some passing carpenter, and that, when drunk, he had nearly beaten his wife to death.</p>
				<p>Resoún replied that he beat his wife, drunk or sober, and still it was not enough; and this set everybody laughing. But about the saw he became suddenly indignant, stepped closer to Ignát and asked:</p>
				<p>"Who stole?..."</p>
				<p>"You did," replied the sturdy Ignát, drawing still closer.</p>
				<p>"Who stole?... Was it not yourself?" shouted Resoún.</p>
				<p>"No, it was you," said Ignát.</p>
				<p>From the saw they went on to a stolen horse, a bag of oats, some strip of kitchen-garden, a dead body; and the two peasants said such terrible things to one another, that if a one-hundredth part of them had been true they would at the very least have legally deserved exile to Siberia.</p>
				<p>In the meantime old Doútlof had chosen another way of defending himself. He did not like his son's shouting, and tried to stop him, saying: "It's a sin.... Leave off, I tell you!"</p>
				<p>At the same time he argued that not only those who had three young men at home were three-men families, but also those whose sons had separated from them.</p>
				<p>Stárostin smiled slightly, cleared his throat, and, stroking his beard with the air of a rich man, answered that it all depended on the proprietress, and that evidently his sons had deserved well, since the order was for them to be exempt.</p>
				<p>Gerásim answered Doútlof's arguments with respect to the families that had broken up, by the remark that they ought not to have been allowed to break up, as was the rule during the lifetime of the late proprietor; that it was no use crying over spilt milk; and that, after all, one could not enlist the only man left in a household.</p>
				<p>"Did they break up their households for fun? Why should they now be completely ruined?" came the voices of the men whose families had separated; and the chatterers joined in, too.</p>
				<p>"You'd better buy a substitute, if you're not satisfied. You can afford it!" said Resoún to Doútlof.</p>
				<p>Doútlof wrapped his coat round him with a despairing gesture, and stepped back behind the others.</p>
				<p>"I suppose you've counted my money?" he muttered angrily. "We shall see what Egór Miháylovitch will say, when he comes from the proprietress."</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">VI</h3>
				<p>At that very moment Egór Miháylovitch came out of the house. One cap after another was lifted, and as the steward approached, all the heads—white, grey, red, brown, fair, or bald in front or on top—were uncovered, and the voices were gradually silenced, till at last all was quiet.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch stepped on to the porch, evidently intending to speak. In his long coat, his hands stuffed awkwardly into the pockets, his cap pulled over his forehead, he stood firmly, his feet apart, on this elevated place, lording it over all these heads—mostly old, bearded and handsome—that were turned towards him. He was now a different man from what he had been when he stood before his mistress. He was majestic.</p>
				<p>"This is the mistress's decision, lads! It is not her wish to give up any of the domestic serfs; but from among you, those whom you yourselves decide on, they shall go. Three are wanted this time. By rights only two and a half are wanted, but the half will be taken into account next time. It comes to the same thing: if it were not to-day, it would have to be to-morrow."</p>
				<p>"Of course, that's quite right!" some voices said.</p>
				<p>"In my opinion," continued Egór Miháylovitch, "Harúshkin and Váska Mitúhin must go; that is evidently God's will."</p>
				<p>"Yes, that's quite right!" said the voices.</p>
				<p>"... The third will have to be one of the Doútlofs, or one out of a two-men family.... What do you say?"</p>
				<p>"Doútlof!" cried the voices. "There are three of them of the right age!"</p>
				<p>And again, slowly, slowly, the shouting increased, and somehow the question of the strip of kitchen-garden and some kind of sacks stolen from the mistress's yard came up again. Egór Miháylovitch had been managing the estate for the last twenty years, and he was a clever and experienced man. He stood and listened for about a quarter of an hour, then he ordered everybody to be quiet and the three younger Doútlofs to draw lots, to see which of the three was to go.</p>
				<p>They prepared the lots, which were shaken up in a hat, and Hrapkóf took one out. It was Elijah's. All became silent.</p>
				<p>"Is it mine? Let me see!" said Elijah in a faltering voice.</p>
				<p>All remained silent. Egór Miháylovitch gave orders that everybody should bring the recruiting money—a tax of seven copecks from every household—next day, and saying that all was finished, dismissed the Meeting. The crowd moved away, the men covered their heads, and as they turned the corner their voices and the sound of their footsteps mingled into a hum. The steward stood on the porch, watching the departing crowd, and when the young Doútlofs had passed him, he beckoned the old man, who had stopped of his own accord, and they went into the office.</p>
				<p>"I am sorry for you, old man," said Egór Miháylovitch, sitting down in an arm-chair in front of the table. "Your turn has come. Won't you buy a recruit to take your nephew's place?"</p>
				<p>The old man, without speaking, gave Egór Miháylovitch a significant look.</p>
				<p>"He can't escape," said Egór Miháylovitch, in answer to that look.</p>
				<p>"We'd be glad enough to buy a substitute, but have not the means, Egór Miháylovitch. Two horses went to the knacker's this summer, and then there was my nephew's wedding.... Evidently it's our fate... for living honestly. It's very well for him to talk!" (He was thinking of Resoún.)</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch rubbed his face with his hand and yawned. He was evidently tired of the subject; besides, he was ready for his tea.</p>
				<p>"Eh, old fellow! Don't you be mean!" said he. "Have a hunt in the cellar; I dare say you'll turn up some four hundred old rouble notes, and I'll get you a substitute—a regular wonder!... The other day a fellow came offering himself."</p>
				<p>"In the <em>government</em>?" asked Doútlof, meaning the town.</p>
				<p>"Well, will you buy him?"</p>
				<p>"I'd be glad enough, God's my witness!... but..."</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch sternly interrupted him.</p>
				<p>"Well, then, listen to me, old man! See that Elijah does himself no injury, and as soon as I send word—whenever that may be—he is to be taken to town at once. You will take him, and you will be answerable for him; but if—which God forbid!—anything should happen to him, I'll send your eldest son instead! Do you hear?"</p>
				<p>"But could not one be sent from a two-man family?... Egór Miháylovitch, this is an affront!" he said. Then, after a pause, he went on, almost with tears:</p>
				<p>"It seems that my brother died a soldier, and now they are taking my boy! How have I deserved such a blow?" and he was ready to fall on his knees.</p>
				<p>"Well, well, go away!" said Egór Miháylovitch. "Nothing can be done. It's the law. Keep an eye on Elijah: you'll have to answer for him!"</p>
				<p>Doútlof went home, thoughtfully tapping the ruts with his stick as he walked.</p>
