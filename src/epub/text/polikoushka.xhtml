				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam! Only it would be a pity if it's the Doútlofs. They're all good fellows, and one of them must go if we don't send at least one of the domestic serfs," said the steward. "As it is, everyone is hinting at them.... But it's just as you please, madam!"</p>
				<p>And he placed his right hand over his left in front of him, inclined his head towards the other shoulder, drew in—almost with a smack—his thin lips, rolled up his eyes, and said no more, evidently intending to keep silent for a long time, and to listen without reply to all the absurdities his mistress was sure to utter.</p>
				<p>The steward—clean-shaven, and dressed in a long coat of a peculiar steward-like cut—who had come to report to his proprietress that autumn evening, was by origin a domestic serf.</p>
				<p>The report, from the lady's point of view, meant listening to a statement of the business done on her estate, and giving instructions for further business. From Egór Miháylovitch's (the steward's) point of view, "reporting" was a ceremony of standing straight on both feet, with turned-out toes, in a corner facing the sofa, and listening to all sorts of chatter unconnected with business, and by different ways and means getting the mistress into a state of mind in which she would quickly and impatiently say, "All right, all right!" to all that Egór Miháylovitch proposed.</p>
				<p>Recruiting was the business under consideration. The Pokróvsk estate had to supply three recruits. Two of them seemed to have been marked out by Fate itself, by a coincidence of family, moral, and economic circumstances. As far as they were concerned, there could be no hesitation or dispute either on the part of the proprietress, the Commune, or of public opinion. But who the third was to be, was a debatable point. The steward was anxious to defend the Doútlofs (in which family there were three men of an age to be recruited), and to send Polikoúshka, a married domestic serf with a very bad reputation, who had been caught more than once stealing sacks, reins, and hay; but the proprietress, who often petted Polikoúshka's ragged children, and improved his morals by exhortations from the Bible, did not wish to send him. Neither did she wish to injure the Doútlofs, whom she did not know and had never even seen. But somehow she did not seem able to grasp the fact, and the steward could not make up his mind to tell her straight out, that if Polikoúshka did not go, one of the Doútlofs would have to.</p>
				<p>"But I don't wish the Doútlofs any ill!" she said feelingly.</p>
				<p>"If you don't, then pay three hundred roubles for a substitute," should have been the steward's reply; but that would have been bad policy.</p>
				<p>So Egór Miháylovitch took up a comfortable position, and even leaned imperceptibly against the lintel of the door, while keeping a servile expression on his face and watching the movements of the lady's lips and the flutter of the frills on her cap, and their shadow on the wall beneath a picture. But he did not consider it at all necessary to attend to the meaning of her words. The lady spoke long, and said much. A desire to yawn gave him cramp behind his ears, but he adroitly turned the spasm into a cough, and, holding his hand to his mouth, gave a croak. A little while ago I saw Lord Palmerston sitting with his hat over his face while a member of the Opposition was storming at the Ministry, and then suddenly rise, and in a three hours' speech answer his opponent point by point. I saw it and was not surprised, because I had seen the same kind of thing hundreds of times going on between Egór Miháylovitch and his mistress. At last—perhaps he was afraid of falling asleep, or thought she was letting herself go too far—changing the weight of his body from his left to his right foot, he began, as he always did, with an unctuous preface:</p>
				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam.... Only, the meeting of the Commune is at present being held in front of my office window, and we must come to some conclusion. The order says that the recruits are to be in town before the Feast of Pokróf.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a> From among the peasants the Doútlofs are being suggested, and there is no one else to suggest. And the Mír does not trouble about your interests. What does it care if it ruins the Doútlofs? Don't I know what a fight they've been having? Ever since I first had the stewardship they have been living in want. The old man's youngest nephew has scarcely had time to grow up to be a help, and now they're to be ruined again! And I, as you well know, am as careful of your property as of my own.... It's a pity, madam, whatever you're pleased to think!... After all, they're neither kith nor kin to me, and I've received nothing from them...."</p>
				<p>"Why, Egór, as if I ever thought of such a thing!" interrupted the lady, and at once suspected him of having been bribed by the Doútlofs.</p>
				<p>"... Only theirs is the best homestead in the whole of Pokróvsk. They're God-fearing, hard-working peasants. The old man has been thirty years churchwarden; he doesn't drink nor use bad language; he goes to church" (the steward well knew with what to bait the hook). "... But the principal thing that I would like to report to you is that he has only two sons; the others are nephews adopted out of charity, and so they ought to cast lots only with the two-men families. Many families have split up because of their improvidence, and their own sons have separated from them, and so they are safe now—while these will have to suffer just because of their charitableness."</p>
				<p>Here the lady could not follow at all. She did not understand what he meant by a "two-men family" nor "charitableness." She only heard sounds and observed the nankeen buttons on the steward's coat. The top one, which he probably did not button up so often, was fixed on tightly; the middle one was hanging by a thread, and ought long ago to have been sewn on. But it is a well-known fact that in a conversation, especially a business conversation, it is not at all necessary to understand what is being said to you, but only to remember what you yourself want to say. The lady acted accordingly.</p>
				<p>"How is it you won't understand, Egór Miháylovitch?" she said. "I have not the least desire that a Doútlof should go as a soldier. One would think that, knowing me as you do, you might credit me with the wish to do everything in my power to help my serfs, and that I don't desire their misfortune, and that I would sacrifice all I possess to escape from this sad necessity and to send neither Doútlof nor Polikoúshka." (I don't know whether it occurred to the steward that to escape the sad necessity there was no need to sacrifice everything—that, in fact, three hundred roubles would be sufficient; but this thought might easily have occurred to him.)</p>
				<p>"I will only say this: that I will not give up Polikoúshka on any account. When, after that affair with the clock, he confessed to me of his own accord, and cried, and gave his word to amend, I talked to him for a long time, and saw that he was touched and sincerely penitent." ("There! She's off now!" thought Egór Miháylovitch, and began examining the marmalade she had in a glass of water: was it orange or lemon? "Slightly bitter, I expect," thought he.) "That is seven months ago now, and he has not once been drunk, and has behaved splendidly. His wife tells me he is a different man. How can you wish me to punish him now that he has reformed? Besides, it would be inhuman to make a soldier of a man who has five children, and he the only man in the family.... No, you'd better not say any more about it, Egór!"</p>
				<p>And the lady took a sip out of the glass. Egór Miháylovitch watched the motion of her throat as the liquid passed down it, and then replied shortly and dryly:</p>
				<p>"Then Doútlof's decided on."</p>
				<p>The lady clasped her hands together.</p>
				<p>"How is it you don't understand? Do I wish Doútlof ill? Have I anything against him? God is my witness, I am prepared to do anything for them...." (She glanced at a picture in the corner, but recollected that it was not an icon.) "Well, never mind... that's not to the point," she thought. And again, strange to say, the idea of the three hundred roubles did not occur to her.... "Well, what can I do? What do I know about it? It's impossible for me to know. Well, then, I rely on you—you know my wishes.... Act so as to satisfy everybody and according to the law.... What's to be done? They are not the only ones: everybody has times of trouble. Only, Polikoúshka can't be sent. You must understand that it would be dreadful of me to do such a thing...."</p>
				<p>She was roused, and would have continued speaking for a long time had not one of her maidservants entered the room at that moment.</p>
				<p>"What is it, Dounyásha?"</p>
				<p>"A peasant has come to ask Egór Miháylovitch if the Meeting is to wait for him," said Dounyásha, and glanced angrily at Egór Miháylovitch. ("Oh, that steward!" she thought; "he's upset the mistress. Now she'll not let one get a wink of sleep till two in the morning!")</p>
				<p>"Well then Egór, go and do the best you can."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam." He did not say anything more about Doútlof. "And who is to go to the fruit merchant to fetch the money?"</p>
				<p>"Has not Peter returned from town?"</p>
				<p>"No, madam."</p>
				<p>"Could not Nicholas go?"</p>
				<p>"Father is down with backache," remarked Dounyásha.</p>
				<p>"Should I go myself to-morrow, madam?" asked the steward.</p>
				<p>"No, Egór; you are wanted here." The lady pondered. "How much is it?"</p>
				<p>"Four hundred and sixty-two silver roubles."</p>
				<p>"Send Polikoúshka," said the lady, with a determined glance at Egór Miháylovitch's face.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch stretched his lips into the semblance of a smile, but without unclosing his teeth, and the expression of his face did not change.</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam."</p>
				<p>"Send him to me."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam;" and Egór Miháylovitch went to his office.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</h3>
				<p>Polikéy (or Polikoúshka, as he was usually contemptuously called), as a man of little importance, of tarnished reputation, and not a native of the village, had no influence either with the housekeeper, the butler, the steward, or the lady's-maid. His cubicle was the very worst, though his family consisted of seven persons. The late proprietor had had these cubicles built in the following manner:</p>
				<p>In the middle of a brick building, about twenty-three feet square, was placed a large brick baking-oven, partly surrounded by a passage, and the four corners of the building were separated from the "collidor" (as the domestic serfs called it) by wooden stable-partitions. So there was not much room in these cubicles, especially in Polikéy's, which was nearest to the door. The family bed, with a quilt and pillow-cases made of print, the baby's cradle, and the three-legged table (on which the cooking and washing were done and all sorts of domestic articles placed, and at which Polikéy—who was a farrier—worked), tubs, clothing, some chickens, a calf, and the seven members of the family, filled the whole cubicle, and could not have moved in it had it not been for their quarter of the brick oven (on which both people and things could lie) and for the possibility of going outside into the porch. That was, perhaps, not easy, for it is rather cold in October, and the seven of them only possessed one sheepskin cloak between them; but, on the other hand, the children could keep warm by running about, and the grown-ups by working, and both the one and the other by climbing on to the top of the oven, where the temperature rose to 120 degrees. It may seem dreadful to live in such conditions, but they did not mind—it was quite possible to live. Akoulína washed and sewed her husband's and her children's clothes, spun, wove and bleached her linen, cooked and baked in the common oven, and quarrelled and gossiped with her neighbours. The monthly allowance of meal sufficed not only for the children, but to add to the cow's food. The firewood was free, and so was food for the cattle, and a little hay from the stables sometimes came their way. They had a strip of kitchen garden. Their cow had calved, and they had their own fowls. Polikéy was employed in the stables to look after two stallions; he bled horses and cattle, cleaned their hoofs, operated on them for lampers, dispensed ointments of his own invention, and for this was paid in money and in kind. Also some of the proprietress's oats used to remain over, for two measures of which a peasant in the village gave twenty pounds of mutton regularly every month. Life would have been quite tolerable, wad there been no worry. But the family had a great grief. Polikéy in his youth had lived at a stud-farm in another village. The stud-groom into whose hands he happened to fall was the greatest thief in the neighbourhood, and got exiled to Siberia. Under this man Polikéy served his apprenticeship, and in his youth got so used to those tricks that in later life, though he would willingly have left them off, he could not get out of the habit. He was a young man, and weak; he had neither father nor mother nor anyone else to teach him. Polikéy liked drink, and did not like to see anything lying about. Whether it was a strap, a piece of harness, a padlock, a bolt, or a thing of greater value, Polikéy found some use for everything. There were people everywhere who accepted these things, and paid for them in drink or in money. Such earnings, so people say, are the easiest to get: no apprenticeship required, no labour nor anything, and he who has once tried that kind of work does not desire any other. It has only one drawback: although you get things cheap and easily, and live pleasantly, yet all of a sudden—through somebody's malice—things go all wrong, the trade fails, everything has to be accounted for at once, and you rue the day you were born.</p>
				<p>And so it happened to Polikéy.</p>
				<p>Polikéy married, and God gave him joy. His wife, the daughter of a herdsman, turned out to be a healthy, intelligent, hard-working woman, who bore him one fine baby after another. And though Polikéy did not give up his trade, all went well till one fine day his luck forsook him and he was caught. And it was all about a trifle: he stole some reins from a peasant. He was found out, beaten, the proprietress was told of it; and he was watched. He was caught a second and a third time. People began to taunt him, the steward threatened to make him go as a soldier, the proprietress gave him a scolding, and his wife wept and was broken-hearted. Everything went wrong. He was a kind-hearted man; not wicked, but only weak; liking drink, and so in the habit of it that he could not leave it off. Sometimes his wife would row at him and even beat him when he came home drunk, and he would cry, saying: "Unfortunate man that I am, what shall I do? Blast my eyes, I'll leave it off! Never again!" A month goes by, and he leaves home, gets drunk, and is not seen again for a couple of days. And his neighbours say: "He must get the money somewhere to go on the spree with!"</p>
				<p>His latest trouble had been about the office clock. There was an old clock there that had not been in working order for a long time. He happened to go in at the open door all alone, and the clock tempted him. He took it and got rid of it in the town. As ill-luck would have it, the shopman to whom he sold the clock was related to one of the domestic serfs; and coming to see her one holiday, spoke about the clock. They—especially the steward, who disliked Polikéy—began making inquiries, just as if it was anybody else's concern! It was all found out and reported to the proprietress, and she sent for him. He at once fell at her feet and pathetically confessed everything, just as his wife had told him to do. He carried out his instructions very well. The proprietress began admonishing him; she talked and talked, and maundered on about God and virtue and a future life, and about wife and children, and at last drove him to tears. She said:</p>
				<p>"I forgive you; only you must promise never to do it again!"</p>
				<p>"Never in all my life. May I go to perdition! May my bowels gush out!" said Polikéy, and wept touchingly.</p>
				<p>Polikéy went home, and for the rest of the day lay on the oven, blubbering like a calf. Since then nothing more had ever been traced to him. Only his life was no longer pleasant; he was looked upon as a thief, and when the time for conscripting drew near, everybody hinted at him.</p>
				<p>Polikéy was a farrier, as already mentioned. How he became one nobody knew, he himself least of all. At the stud-farm, when he worked under the head-groom who got exiled, his only duties were to clean the stables, sometimes to groom the horses, and to carry water. So he could not have learned his trade there. Then he became a weaver; after that he worked in a garden, weeding the paths; then he was condemned to break bricks for some offence; then he went into service with a merchant, paying a yearly fine to his proprietress for permission to do so. So evidently he could not have had any experience as a veterinary; yet somehow during his last stay at home, his reputation as a wonderfully and even a rather supernaturally clever farrier began gradually to spread. He bled a horse once or twice; then threw one down and prodded about in its thigh, and then demanded that it should be placed in a stall, where he began cutting its frog till it bled. Though the horse struggled, and even squealed, he said this meant "letting out the sub-hoof blood"! Then he explained to a peasant that it was absolutely necessary to let the blood from both veins, "for greater lightness," and began hammering in the blunt lancet with a mallet; then he bandaged the innkeeper's horse under its belly with the selvedge torn from his wife's shawl, and at last he began to sprinkle all sorts of sores with vitriol, to drench them with something out of a bottle, and sometimes to give internally whatever came into his head. And the more horses he tormented and killed, the more he was believed in, and the more of them were brought to him.</p>
				<p>I feel that for us educated people it would hardly be proper to laugh at Polikéy. The methods he employed are the same that have influenced our fathers, that influence us, and will influence our children. The peasant lying prone on the head of his one mare (which not only constitutes the whole of his wealth, but is almost one of his family) and gazing with faith and horror at Polikéy's frowning look of importance and thin arms with upturned sleeves, as, with the healing rag or a bottle of vitriol between his teeth, the latter presses the sore place and boldly cuts into the living flesh (with the secret thought, "The one-eyed brute will never get over it!") and at the same time pretending to know where there is blood and where matter, which is a tendon and which a vein—that peasant cannot conceive that Polikéy has lifted his hand to cut, without due knowledge. He himself could not have done it. And once the thing is done, he will not reproach himself with having given permission to cut unnecessarily. I don't know about you, but I have experienced just the same with the doctor, who in obedience to my request was tormenting those dear to me. The lancet, the whitish bottle of sublimate, and the words, "the staggers—glanders—to let blood or matter," etc., do they not come to the same thing as "nerves, rheumatism, organism," etc.? <i xml:lang="de">Wage du zu irren und zu träume</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-206" id="noteref-206" epub:type="noteref">206</a> does not refer to poets so much as to doctors and veterinary surgeons.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">III</h3>
				<p>On the evening when the village Meeting, in the cold darkness of an October night, was choosing the recruits and vociferating in front of the office, Polikéy sat on the edge of his bed, rubbing down some horse medicine upon the table with a bottle; but what it was, he himself did not know. He had there sublimate of mercury, sulphur, Glauber's salts, and some kind of herb which he had gathered, having once imagined it to be good for broken wind, and now considered not useless in other disorders. The children had already gone to bed—two on the oven, two on the bed, and one in the cradle beside which Akoulína sat spinning. The remainder of a candle—one of the proprietress's candles which had not been put away carefully enough—was burning in a wooden candlestick on the window-sill, and Akoulína every now and then got up to snuff it with her fingers, so that her husband should not have to break off his important occupation. There existed independent thinkers who regarded Polikéy as a worthless farrier and a worthless man. Others, the majority, considered him a bad man, but a great master of his art; but Akoulína, though she often scolded and even beat her husband, thought him the first among farriers and the first among men. Polikéy sprinkled some kind of specific on to the palm of his hand (he never used a balance, and spoke ironically about the Germans who use balances: "This is not a pharmacy," he used to say). Polikéy weighed the specific in his hand and tossed it up, but there did not seem enough of it, and he poured in ten times as much. "I'll put in the lot," he said to himself. "It will pick 'em up better."</p>
				<p>Akoulína quickly turned round at the sound of the autocrat's voice, expecting some order; but, seeing that the business did not concern her, shrugged her shoulders.</p>
				<p>"What knowledge!... Where does he get it?" she thought, and went on spinning. The paper which had held the specific fell to the floor. Akoulína did not let this pass unnoticed.</p>
				<p>"Annie," she cried, "look! Father has dropped something. Pick it up!"</p>
				<p>Annie put out her thin little bare legs from under the cloak with which she was covered, slid down under the table like a kitten, and got the paper.</p>
				<p>"Here, daddy," she said, and with her little chilled feet darted back into bed.</p>
				<p>"Don't puth!" squeaked her lisping younger sister sleepily.</p>
				<p>"I'll give it you!" muttered Akoulína; and both heads disappeared again under the cloak.</p>
				<p>"He'll give me three roubles," said Polikéy, corking up the bottle. "I'll cure the horse. It's even too cheap," he added, "brain-splitting work!... Akoulína, go and ask Nikíta for a little 'baccy. I'll return it to-morrow;" and Polikéy took out of his trouser-pocket a limewood pipe-stem which had once been painted, with a mouthpiece of sealing-wax, and began fixing it on to the bowl.</p>
				<p>Akoulína left her spindle and went out, managing to steer clear of everything—though this was not easy. Polikéy opened the cupboard and put away the medicine, then tilted a vódka bottle into his mouth, but it was empty, and he made a grimace; but when his wife brought the tobacco he sat down on the edge of the bed after filling and lighting his pipe, and his face shone with the content and pride of a man who has completed his day's task. Whether he was thinking how on the morrow he would catch hold of a horse's tongue and pour his wonderful mixture down its throat, or considering the fact that a useful person never gets a refusal—"There, now! Hadn't Nikíta sent him some tobacco?"—anyhow, he felt happy.</p>
				<p>Suddenly the door, hanging on one hinge, was thrown open, and a maidservant from <em>up there</em>—not the second maid, but the third, the little one that was kept to run errands—entered the cubicle. (<em>Up there</em>, as everyone knows, means the proprietor's house, even if it is situated lower down.) Aksyúta—that was the girl's name—always flew like a bullet, and did it without bending her arms, which, keeping time with the speed of her flight, swung like pendulums, not by her sides, but in front of her. Her cheeks were always redder than her pink dress, and her tongue moved as rapidly as her legs. She flew into the room, and for some reason catching hold of the stove, began to sway to and fro; then, as if reluctant on any account to bring out more than two or three words at a time, she all of a sudden breathlessly addressed Akoulína as follows:</p>
				<p>"The mistress... has given orders... that Polikoúshka should come this minute... orders to come up...."</p>
				<p>She stopped, breathing heavily.</p>
				<p>"Egór Miháylovitch has been with the mistress... they talked about <em>rickruits</em>... they mentioned Polikoúshka... Avdótya Nikoláyevna... has ordered you to come this minute... Avdótya Nikoláyevna has ordered..." again a sigh," to come this minute...."</p>
				<p>For half a minute Aksyúta looked round at Polikéy and at Akoulína and the children—who had put out their heads from under their bed-clothes—picked up a nutshell that lay on the stove, and threw it at little Annie. Then she repeated:</p>
				<p>"To come this minute!..." and rushed out of the room like a whirlwind, the pendulums swinging as usual at right angles to the line of her flight.</p>
				<p>Akoulína again rose, and got her husband's boots—abominable soldier's boots, with holes in them—and got down his coat and passed it to him without speaking.</p>
				<p>"Won't you change your shirt, Polikéy?"</p>
				<p>"No," he answered.</p>
				<p>Akoulína never once looked at his face while he put on his boots and coat, and she did well not to look. Polikéy's face was pale, his nether jaw trembled, and in his eyes there was that tearful, submissive and deeply mournful look one only sees in the eyes of kindly, weak, and guilty people.</p>
				<p>He combed his hair, and was going out; but his wife stopped him, hid the string of his shirt that hung down from under his coat, and put his cap on for him.</p>
				<p>"What's that, Polikoúshka? Has the mistress sent for you?" came the voice of the carpenter's wife from behind the partition.</p>
				<p>Only that morning the carpenter's wife had had high words with Akoulína about her pot of potash<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-207" id="noteref-207" epub:type="noteref">207</a> that Polikéy's children had upset, and at first she was pleased to hear Polikéy being summoned to the mistress: most likely for no good. She was a cute, diplomatic lady, with a biting tongue. Nobody knew better than she how to pay anyone out with a word: so she imagined.</p>
				<p>"I expect you'll be sent to town to do the shopping," she continued. "I suppose a safe person must be chosen to do that job, so you'll be sent! Please buy a quarter of a pound of tea for me there, Polikéy."</p>
				<p>Akoulína forced back her tears, and an angry expression distorted her lips. She felt as if she could have clutched "that vixen the joiner's wife, by her mangy hair." But when she looked at her children, and thought that they would be left fatherless and she herself a soldier's wife and as good as widowed, she forgot the sharp-tongued joiner's wife, hid her face in her hands, sat down on the bed, and let her head sink in the pillows.</p>
				<p>"Mammy, you cluth me!" lisped her little girl, pulling the cloak with which she was covered from under her mother's elbow.</p>
				<p>"If you'd only die, all of you! I've brought you into the world for nothing but sorrow!" exclaimed Akoulína, and sobbed aloud, to the joy of the joiner's wife, who had not yet forgotten the potash.</p>
