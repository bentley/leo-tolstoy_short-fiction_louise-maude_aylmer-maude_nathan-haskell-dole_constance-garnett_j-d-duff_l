				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam! Only it would be a pity if it's the Doútlofs. They're all good fellows, and one of them must go if we don't send at least one of the domestic serfs," said the steward. "As it is, everyone is hinting at them.... But it's just as you please, madam!"</p>
				<p>And he placed his right hand over his left in front of him, inclined his head towards the other shoulder, drew in—almost with a smack—his thin lips, rolled up his eyes, and said no more, evidently intending to keep silent for a long time, and to listen without reply to all the absurdities his mistress was sure to utter.</p>
				<p>The steward—clean-shaven, and dressed in a long coat of a peculiar steward-like cut—who had come to report to his proprietress that autumn evening, was by origin a domestic serf.</p>
				<p>The report, from the lady's point of view, meant listening to a statement of the business done on her estate, and giving instructions for further business. From Egór Miháylovitch's (the steward's) point of view, "reporting" was a ceremony of standing straight on both feet, with turned-out toes, in a corner facing the sofa, and listening to all sorts of chatter unconnected with business, and by different ways and means getting the mistress into a state of mind in which she would quickly and impatiently say, "All right, all right!" to all that Egór Miháylovitch proposed.</p>
				<p>Recruiting was the business under consideration. The Pokróvsk estate had to supply three recruits. Two of them seemed to have been marked out by Fate itself, by a coincidence of family, moral, and economic circumstances. As far as they were concerned, there could be no hesitation or dispute either on the part of the proprietress, the Commune, or of public opinion. But who the third was to be, was a debatable point. The steward was anxious to defend the Doútlofs (in which family there were three men of an age to be recruited), and to send Polikoúshka, a married domestic serf with a very bad reputation, who had been caught more than once stealing sacks, reins, and hay; but the proprietress, who often petted Polikoúshka's ragged children, and improved his morals by exhortations from the Bible, did not wish to send him. Neither did she wish to injure the Doútlofs, whom she did not know and had never even seen. But somehow she did not seem able to grasp the fact, and the steward could not make up his mind to tell her straight out, that if Polikoúshka did not go, one of the Doútlofs would have to.</p>
				<p>"But I don't wish the Doútlofs any ill!" she said feelingly.</p>
				<p>"If you don't, then pay three hundred roubles for a substitute," should have been the steward's reply; but that would have been bad policy.</p>
				<p>So Egór Miháylovitch took up a comfortable position, and even leaned imperceptibly against the lintel of the door, while keeping a servile expression on his face and watching the movements of the lady's lips and the flutter of the frills on her cap, and their shadow on the wall beneath a picture. But he did not consider it at all necessary to attend to the meaning of her words. The lady spoke long, and said much. A desire to yawn gave him cramp behind his ears, but he adroitly turned the spasm into a cough, and, holding his hand to his mouth, gave a croak. A little while ago I saw Lord Palmerston sitting with his hat over his face while a member of the Opposition was storming at the Ministry, and then suddenly rise, and in a three hours' speech answer his opponent point by point. I saw it and was not surprised, because I had seen the same kind of thing hundreds of times going on between Egór Miháylovitch and his mistress. At last—perhaps he was afraid of falling asleep, or thought she was letting herself go too far—changing the weight of his body from his left to his right foot, he began, as he always did, with an unctuous preface:</p>
				<p>"Just as you please to order, madam.... Only, the meeting of the Commune is at present being held in front of my office window, and we must come to some conclusion. The order says that the recruits are to be in town before the Feast of Pokróf.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a> From among the peasants the Doútlofs are being suggested, and there is no one else to suggest. And the Mír does not trouble about your interests. What does it care if it ruins the Doútlofs? Don't I know what a fight they've been having? Ever since I first had the stewardship they have been living in want. The old man's youngest nephew has scarcely had time to grow up to be a help, and now they're to be ruined again! And I, as you well know, am as careful of your property as of my own.... It's a pity, madam, whatever you're pleased to think!... After all, they're neither kith nor kin to me, and I've received nothing from them...."</p>
				<p>"Why, Egór, as if I ever thought of such a thing!" interrupted the lady, and at once suspected him of having been bribed by the Doútlofs.</p>
				<p>"... Only theirs is the best homestead in the whole of Pokróvsk. They're God-fearing, hard-working peasants. The old man has been thirty years churchwarden; he doesn't drink nor use bad language; he goes to church" (the steward well knew with what to bait the hook). "... But the principal thing that I would like to report to you is that he has only two sons; the others are nephews adopted out of charity, and so they ought to cast lots only with the two-men families. Many families have split up because of their improvidence, and their own sons have separated from them, and so they are safe now—while these will have to suffer just because of their charitableness."</p>
				<p>Here the lady could not follow at all. She did not understand what he meant by a "two-men family" nor "charitableness." She only heard sounds and observed the nankeen buttons on the steward's coat. The top one, which he probably did not button up so often, was fixed on tightly; the middle one was hanging by a thread, and ought long ago to have been sewn on. But it is a well-known fact that in a conversation, especially a business conversation, it is not at all necessary to understand what is being said to you, but only to remember what you yourself want to say. The lady acted accordingly.</p>
				<p>"How is it you won't understand, Egór Miháylovitch?" she said. "I have not the least desire that a Doútlof should go as a soldier. One would think that, knowing me as you do, you might credit me with the wish to do everything in my power to help my serfs, and that I don't desire their misfortune, and that I would sacrifice all I possess to escape from this sad necessity and to send neither Doútlof nor Polikoúshka." (I don't know whether it occurred to the steward that to escape the sad necessity there was no need to sacrifice everything—that, in fact, three hundred roubles would be sufficient; but this thought might easily have occurred to him.)</p>
				<p>"I will only say this: that I will not give up Polikoúshka on any account. When, after that affair with the clock, he confessed to me of his own accord, and cried, and gave his word to amend, I talked to him for a long time, and saw that he was touched and sincerely penitent." ("There! She's off now!" thought Egór Miháylovitch, and began examining the marmalade she had in a glass of water: was it orange or lemon? "Slightly bitter, I expect," thought he.) "That is seven months ago now, and he has not once been drunk, and has behaved splendidly. His wife tells me he is a different man. How can you wish me to punish him now that he has reformed? Besides, it would be inhuman to make a soldier of a man who has five children, and he the only man in the family.... No, you'd better not say any more about it, Egór!"</p>
				<p>And the lady took a sip out of the glass. Egór Miháylovitch watched the motion of her throat as the liquid passed down it, and then replied shortly and dryly:</p>
				<p>"Then Doútlof's decided on."</p>
				<p>The lady clasped her hands together.</p>
				<p>"How is it you don't understand? Do I wish Doútlof ill? Have I anything against him? God is my witness, I am prepared to do anything for them...." (She glanced at a picture in the corner, but recollected that it was not an icon.) "Well, never mind... that's not to the point," she thought. And again, strange to say, the idea of the three hundred roubles did not occur to her.... "Well, what can I do? What do I know about it? It's impossible for me to know. Well, then, I rely on you—you know my wishes.... Act so as to satisfy everybody and according to the law.... What's to be done? They are not the only ones: everybody has times of trouble. Only, Polikoúshka can't be sent. You must understand that it would be dreadful of me to do such a thing...."</p>
				<p>She was roused, and would have continued speaking for a long time had not one of her maidservants entered the room at that moment.</p>
				<p>"What is it, Dounyásha?"</p>
				<p>"A peasant has come to ask Egór Miháylovitch if the Meeting is to wait for him," said Dounyásha, and glanced angrily at Egór Miháylovitch. ("Oh, that steward!" she thought; "he's upset the mistress. Now she'll not let one get a wink of sleep till two in the morning!")</p>
				<p>"Well then Egór, go and do the best you can."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam." He did not say anything more about Doútlof. "And who is to go to the fruit merchant to fetch the money?"</p>
				<p>"Has not Peter returned from town?"</p>
				<p>"No, madam."</p>
				<p>"Could not Nicholas go?"</p>
				<p>"Father is down with backache," remarked Dounyásha.</p>
				<p>"Should I go myself to-morrow, madam?" asked the steward.</p>
				<p>"No, Egór; you are wanted here." The lady pondered. "How much is it?"</p>
				<p>"Four hundred and sixty-two silver roubles."</p>
				<p>"Send Polikoúshka," said the lady, with a determined glance at Egór Miháylovitch's face.</p>
				<p>Egór Miháylovitch stretched his lips into the semblance of a smile, but without unclosing his teeth, and the expression of his face did not change.</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam."</p>
				<p>"Send him to me."</p>
				<p>"Yes, madam;" and Egór Miháylovitch went to his office.</p>
